👋 **Greetings!** My name is Maxime Labonne, and I am currently a senior applied researcher at [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/). I hold a M.Sc. degree in computer science from [INSA CVL](https://www.insa-centrevaldeloire.fr/en), and a Ph.D. in machine learning and cyber security from the [Polytechnic Institute of Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en).

In this blog, I aim to provide **practical tutorials and guides** on AI and machine learning. I believe in starting with implementation and practice, and then diving into explanations. By retracing the thought process of the original authors of the algorithms we use every day, we can gain a deeper understanding of their design and the importance of each component.

I hope we can have fun together and learn a few things along the way!

If you want to contact me, feel free to send a mail at <a href="mailto:labonne.maxime&commat;gmail.com">this address</a>.
