    "Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) can only perform next-token prediction, making them unable to answer questions. This is why these base models are then fine-tuned on pairs of instructions and answers to act as helpful assistants. However, this process can still be flawed: fine-tuned LLMs can be biased, toxic, harmful, etc. This is where Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "RLHF provides different answers to the LLM, which are ranked according to a desired behavior (helpfulness, toxicity, etc.). The model learns to output the best answer among these candidates, hence mimicking the behavior we want to instill. Often seen as a way to censor models, this process has recently become popular for improving performance, as shown in [neural-chat-7b-v3-1](https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will create [NeuralHermes-2.5](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B), by fine-tuning [OpenHermes-2.5](https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B) using a RLHF-like technique: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For this purpose, we will introduce a preference dataset, describe how the DPO algorithm works, and apply it to our model. We'll see that it significantly improves the performance of the base model on the Open LLM Leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per usual, the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course/blob/main/Fine_tune_a_Mistral_7b_model_with_DPO.ipynb) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15iFBr1xWgztXvhrj5I9fBv20c7CFOPBE?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🥇 Preference datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Preference datasets are not standardized, but they typically consist of a collection of answers that are ranked by humans. This ranking is essential, as the RLHF process fine-tunes LLMs to output the preferred answer. Here is an example of [Anthropic/hh-rlhf](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf/viewer/default/train), a popular preference dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Tp5Sw7j.png\" width=\"550\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the dataset is straightforward: for each row, there is one chosen (preferred) answer, and one rejected answer. The goal of RLHF is to guide the model to output the preferred answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preference datasets are notoriously costly and difficult to make, as they require collecting manual feedback from humans. This feedback is also subjective and can easily be biased toward confident (but wrong) answers or contradict itself (different annotators have different values). Over time, several solutions have been proposed to tackle these issues, such as replacing human feedback with AI feedback ([RLAIF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073)).\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets also tend to be a lot smaller than fine-tuning datasets. To illustrate this, the excellent [neural-chat-7b-v3-1](https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1) (best 7B LLM on the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) when it was released) uses 518k samples for fine-tuning ([Open-Orca/SlimOrca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/SlimOrca)) but only 12.9k samples for RLHF ([Intel/orca_dpo_pairs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Intel/orca_dpo_pairs)). In this case, the authors generated answers with GPT-4/3.5 to create the preferred answers, and with [Llama 2 13b chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)  to create the rejected responses. It's a smart way to bypass human feedback and only rely on models with different levels of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 Direct Preference Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "While the concept of RLHF has been used in robotics for a long time, it was popularized for LLMs in OpenAI's paper [Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08593.pdf). In this paper, the authors present a framework where a reward model is trained to approximate human feedback. This reward model is then used to optimize the fine-tuned model's policy using the [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) (PPO) algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zB2lExC.png\" width=\"700\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept of PPO revolves around making smaller, incremental updates to the policy, as larger updates can lead to instability or suboptimal solutions. From experience, this technique is unfortunately still unstable (loss diverges), difficult to reproduce (numerous hyperparameters, sensitive to random seeds), and computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) comes into play. DPO simplifies control by treating the task as a classification problem. Concretely, it uses two models: the **trained model** (or policy model) and a copy of it called the **reference model**. During training, the goal is to make sure the trained model outputs higher probabilities for preferred answers than the reference model. Conversely, we also want it to output lower probabilities for rejected answers. It means we're penalizing the LLM for bad answers and rewarding it for good ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pd7BAzp.png\" width=\"650\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the LLM itself as a reward model and employing binary cross-entropy objectives, DPO efficiently aligns the model's outputs with human preferences without the need for extensive sampling, reward model fitting, or intricate hyperparameter adjustments. It results in a more stable, more efficient, and computationally less demanding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💾 Formatting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll fine-tune the excellent [OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B), which is a Mistral-7b model that was only supervised fine-tuned. To this end, we'll use the [Intel/orca_dpo_pairs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Intel/orca_dpo_pairs) dataset to align our model and improve its performance. We call this new model NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B.\n",

    "Here's the answer from the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) system that has been trained on vast amounts of text data. These models are designed to understand and generate human language, allowing them to perform various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, language translation, and question answering. Large language models typically use deep learning techniques, like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, to learn patterns and relationships in the data, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. The size of these models, in terms of the number of parameters and the volume of data they are trained on, plays a significant role in their ability to comprehend and produce complex language structures.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything seems to be working, we can now evaluate the merged model. As this is a general-purpose model, we can leverage the [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) to evaluate it. As the process is quite resource-intensive, we can also directly submit it for evaluation on the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard). It took a few days, but here are the results compared to other OpenHermes models:\n",

    "Compared to the original model, NeuralHermes-2-5-Mistral-7B model improved the average score by 6.7 points (particularly on GSM8K). This is an unexpectedly large improvement, which showcases the power of Direct Preference Optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we fine-tuned an already supervised fine-tuned model using DPO and created our own [NeuralHermes-2.5](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B) model. By leveraging a high-quality preference dataset, we created a sample-efficient fine-tuning pipeline that produced a significant improvement on the Open LLM Leaderboard. If you want to give it a try, you can find quantized variants of this model or use this [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zhangtao103239/NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF-Chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our fine-tuning pipeline can still be improved in different ways. For example, the preference dataset is still quite raw and could be improved with more filtering and by using different models. In addition, numerous hyperparameters can still be tweaked to achieve better results. In particular, the learning rate can still be lowered to train the model on more steps and inject more preference data.\n",
