Naturally, reinforcement learning is a pertinent framework to train this agent. More specifically, deep RL seems to be the solution since we're processing images to select the best actions.\n",

    "* **Pure deep RL**: the agent is trained from scratch by interacting with the environment. It is rewarded every time it chops a tree.\n",

    "\n",
    "The two approaches have the same outcome, but they're not equivalent. According to the authors of the [MineRL 2021 competition](https://github.com/KarolisRam/MineRL2021-Intro-baselines), it takes **8 hours** for the pure RL solution and **15 minutes** for the imitation learning agent to reach the same level of performance.\n",

    "In this paradigm, we'll use the CNN to get a healthy amount of wood (3000 steps). Then, we can **script a sequence** to craft planks, sticks, a crafting table, a wooden pickaxe, and start mining stone (it should be below our feet). This stone can then be used to craft a stone pickaxe, which can mine iron ore.\n",

    "This is when things get complicated: iron ore is **quite rare**, so we would need to run the game for a while to find a deposit. Then, we would have to craft a furnace and melt it to get the iron pickaxe. Finally, we would have to go even deeper and be **even luckier** to obtain a diamond without falling into lava.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, it's doable but the outcome is fairly random. We could train another agent to [find diamonds](https://minerl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/index.html#minerlobtaindiamond-v0), and even a third one to [create the iron pickaxe](https://minerl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/index.html#minerlobtainironpickaxe-v0). If you're interested in more complex approaches, you can read the results of the [MineRL Diamond 2021 Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10583) by Kanervisto et al. It describes several solutions using different clever techniques, including end-to-end deep learning architectures. Nonetheless, it is a complex problem and no team managed to consistently find diamonds, if at all.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you enjoyed this little guide to reinforcement learning in Minecraft. Beyond its obvious popularity, Minecraft is an interesting environment to try and test RL agents. Like [NetHack](https://nethackchallenge.com/), it requires a **thorough knowledge** of its mechanics to plan precise sequences of actions in a procedurally-generated world. In this article,\n",
    "\n",
    "* We learned how to use **MineRL**;\n",
    "* We saw **two approaches** (script and behavior cloning) and how to combine them;\n",
    "* We **visualized** the agent's actions with short videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main drawback of the environment is its **slow processing time**. Minecraft is not a lightweight game like NetHack or Pong, which is why the agents take a long time to be trained. If this is a problem for you, I would recommend lighter environments like [Gym Retro](https://openai.com/blog/gym-retro/).\n",
