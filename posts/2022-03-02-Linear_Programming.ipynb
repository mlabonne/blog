    "Linear programming is a technique to **optimize any problem** with multiple variables and constraints. It's a simple but powerful tool every data scientist should master.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a strategist recruiting an army. You have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Three resources**: 🌾food, 🪵wood, and 🪙gold\n",
    "* **Three units**: 🗡️swordsmen, 🏹bowmen, and 🐎horsemen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horsemen are stronger than bowmen, who are in turn stronger than swordsmen. The following table provides the cost and power of each unit:\n",

    "Now we have 1200 🌾food, 800 🪵wood, and 600 🪙gold. How should we **maximize the power of our army** considering these resources?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could simply find the unit with the best power/cost ratio, take as many of them as possible, and repeat the process with the other two units. But this \"guess and check\" solution might **not even be optimal**...\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine we have **millions of units and resources**: the previous greedy strategy is likely to completely miss the optimal solution. It is possible to use a machine learning algorithm (e.g., a genetic algorithm) to solve this problem, but we have no guarantee that the solution will be optimal either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, there is a method that can solve our problem in an optimal way: **linear programming** (or linear optimization), which is part of the field of [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) (OR). In this article, we'll use it to find the best numbers of swordsmen, bowmen, and horsemen to build the **army with the highest power possible**.\n",

    "Great! The solver found an optimal solution: our army has a **total power of 💪1800** with 6 🗡️swordsmen and 6 🐎horsemen (sorry bowmen!).\n",

Solvers have characteristics we have to take into account, and **GLOP doesn't handle integers**. This is another proof that building reusable models is more than just convenient.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw through this example the five main steps of any linear optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choosing a solver**: in our case, we selected GLOP for convenience.\n",
    "2. **Declaring variables**: the parameters to optimize were the number of swordsmen, bowmen, and horsemen.\n",
    "3. **Declaring constraints**: each of these units has a cost. The total cost could not exceed our limited resources.\n",
    "4. **Defining objective**: the criterion to maximize was the total power of this army. It could have been something else, like the number of units.\n",
    "5. **Optimizing**: GLOP found an optimal solution to this problem in less than a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"/images/linearoptimization/infographic.png\" width=600></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main benefit of linear programming: the algorithm gives us a **guarantee that the solution that was found is optimal** (with a certain error). This guarantee is powerful, but comes at a cost: the model can be so complex that the solver takes years (or more) to find an optimal solution. In this scenario, we have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can **stop the solver** after a certain time (and probably obtain a suboptimal answer);\n",
    "* We can use a **metaheuristic** like a genetic algorithm to calculate an excellent solution in a short amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next article, we'll talk about the different types of optimization problems and generalize our approach to an entire class of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you enjoyed this introduction! Feel free to share it and spread the knowledge about linear optimization. [**Let's connect on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/maximelabonne) where I post summaries of these articles. Cheers!\n",
