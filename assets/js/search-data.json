            "title": "Introduction to Constraint Programming in Python",
            "content": "Constraint Programming is a technique to find every solution that respects a set of predefined constraints. . It is an invaluable tool for data scientists to solve a huge variety of problems, such as scheduling, timetabling, sequencing, etc. In this article, we&#39;ll see how to use CP in two different ways: . Satisfiability: the goal is to find one or multiple feasible solutions (i.e., solutions that respect our constraints) by narrowing down a large set of potential solutions; | Optimization: the goal is to find the best feasible solution according to an objective function, just like Linear Programming (LP). | We&#39;ll use CP-SAT from Google OR-Tools, an excellent free and open source CP solver. Note that it is different from MPSolver, which is dedicated to Linear and Mixed Integer Programming. The difference between CP and LP is quite confusing, we&#39;ll touch on this topic at the end of the article. . You can run the code with the following Google Colab notebook. . !python -m pip install --upgrade --user -q ortools . &#129686; I. Satisfiability with the 3 scouts problem . In the previous article, we created an army to defeat our opponent. But there was one small problem: we had to guess how powerful his army was. . This time, let&#39;s send scouts to know the exact number. Our 3 scouts observed the enemy camp, and this is what they tell us: . Scout 1: &quot;the number of soldiers is a multiple of 13&quot;; | Scout 2: &quot;the number of soldiers is a multiple of 19&quot;; | Scout 3: &quot;the number of soldiers is a multiple of 37&quot;; | They all agree that the number of soldiers doesn&#39;t exceed 10,000. | . Our scouts have a personal way of counting soldiers, but we can combine these three observations to make a model. . Let&#39;s call the number of soldiers $army$. We can translate our problem into the following congruence system: . $$ army equiv 0 mod 13 army equiv 0 mod 19 army equiv 0 mod 37 $$If you&#39;re not familiar with this notation, this is what it means in programming terms: . $$ army % 13 = 0 army % 19 = 0 army % 37 = 0 $$Let&#39;s implement it with OR-Tools. The first thing we need to do is to import and create the CP-SAT model and solver. . from ortools.sat.python import cp_model # Instantiate model and solver model = cp_model.CpModel() solver = cp_model.CpSolver() . The modeling process is very similar to what we did in Linear Programming. . The first step to create our CP model is to declare the variables. In this example, we only have one: $army$, the number of soldiers. . We have to give lower and upper bounds. The lower bound is 1 since we know there&#39;s an army, and the upper bound is 10,000 according to the scouts: . $$1 leq army leq 10 000$$ . In OR-Tools, we use the NewIntVar method to create this variable. . army = model.NewIntVar(1, 10000, &#39;army&#39;) . The second step is to declare the constraints. . We identified three constraints in this example. Modulo is a special operator, so we need a specific function to handle it with CP-SAT: AddModuloEquality. You can find a reference guide at this address if you need other methods. . # variable % mod = target ‚Üí (target, variable, mod) model.AddModuloEquality(0, army, 13) model.AddModuloEquality(0, army, 19) model.AddModuloEquality(0, army, 37) . Unlike Linear Programming, we don&#39;t have to define an objective function here. . The reason is simple: there is nothing to optimize! We just want to find a feasible solution that satisfies our constraints, but there is no &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; answers. This is a key feature of Constraint Programming. . Our model is complete, we can now ask OR-Tools to solve it. . status = solver.Solve(model) # If a solution has been found, print results if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE: print(&#39;================= Solution =================&#39;) print(f&#39;Solved in {solver.WallTime():.2f} milliseconds&#39;) print() print(f&#39;ü™ñ Army = {solver.Value(army)}&#39;) print() print(&#39;Check solution:&#39;) print(f&#39; - Constraint 1: {solver.Value(army)} % 13 = {solver.Value(army) % 13}&#39;) print(f&#39; - Constraint 2: {solver.Value(army)} % 19 = {solver.Value(army) % 19}&#39;) print(f&#39; - Constraint 3: {solver.Value(army)} % 37 = {solver.Value(army) % 37}&#39;) else: print(&#39;The solver could not find a solution.&#39;) . ================= Solution ================= Solved in 0.01 milliseconds ü™ñ Army = 9139 Check solution: - Constraint 1: 9139 % 13 = 0 - Constraint 2: 9139 % 19 = 0 - Constraint 3: 9139 % 37 = 0 . We obtained our solution in less than a millisecond: there are 9,139 soldiers in the enemy army. Huzzah, we can now fire the scouts! . We limited the search space with an upper bound of 10,000, which gave us a unique solution. But is it still the case if we push this limit? . Another perk of CP is the ability to find every possible solution to a problem. This might take a long time when the search space is large because the solver has to brute force the entire space (instead of reducing it with heuristics). Let&#39;s explore this feature by printing every possible solution with a new upper bound of 100,000. . With OR-Tools, we ask the solver to look for every possible solution thanks to the enumerate_all_solutions parameter. We then assign it a callback class that prints every solution the solver finds. . model = cp_model.CpModel() solver = cp_model.CpSolver() # 1. Variable army = model.NewIntVar(1, 100000, &#39;army&#39;) # 2. Constraints model.AddModuloEquality(0, army, 13) model.AddModuloEquality(0, army, 19) model.AddModuloEquality(0, army, 37) class PrintSolutions(cp_model.CpSolverSolutionCallback): &quot;&quot;&quot;Callback to print every solution.&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, variable): cp_model.CpSolverSolutionCallback.__init__(self) self.__variable = variable def on_solution_callback(self): print(self.Value(self.__variable)) # Solve with callback solution_printer = PrintSolutions(army) solver.parameters.enumerate_all_solutions = True status = solver.Solve(model, solution_printer) . 9139 18278 27417 36556 45695 54834 63973 73112 82251 91390 . We found 10 solutions! This was to be expected since we increased the upper bound tenfold: these solutions all are multiples of 9,139. . As you can see, this example has nothing to do with optimization: it&#39;s a pure satisfiability problem. On another note, this congruence system can be solved manually with the Chinese remainder theorem. But CP is not limited to that... . &#127867; II. Optimization and beer . Let&#39;s see another problem: our army will face the enemy in a few days. In the meantime, the quartermaster has to prepare the rations that will be used during the campaign. . The space in the supply wagons is limited and some rations are more popular than others. There are three possible rations: . ü•ñ Bread: it takes only 1 space but soldiers don&#39;t like it that much with a popularity of 3; | ü•© Meat: it takes 3 spaces and has a popularity of 10; | üç∫ Beer: it takes 7 spaces but soldiers love it with a popularity of 26. | . The supply wagons have a capacity of 19 spaces. How to select the best rations to maximize the popularity? . This is an optimization problem we&#39;ve already seen: actually, it is a variant of the famous knapsack problem. We could reuse the code from the previous article and just change the input parameters. . This time, we&#39;ll solve it using Constraint Programming. This paradigm is not limited to finding feasible solutions. It can also perform optimization using different algorithms to handle this overhead. . Let&#39;s create a model of the problem. First of all, we have to declare three variables: ü•ñbread, ü•©meat, and üç∫beer. It&#39;s possible to have 0 of them, but their number cannot exceed the maximal capacity. . $$0 leq bread leq capacity 0 leq meat leq capacity 0 leq beer leq capacity$$ model = cp_model.CpModel() solver = cp_model.CpSolver() # 1. Variables capacity = 19 bread = model.NewIntVar(0, capacity, &#39;bread&#39;) meat = model.NewIntVar(0, capacity, &#39;meat&#39;) beer = model.NewIntVar(0, capacity, &#39;beer&#39;) . This time, we only have one constraint: the space occupied by the bread, the meat, and the beer cannot exceed the wagons&#39; capacity (19). . $$1 times bread + 3 times meat + 7 times beer leq 19$$ . model.Add(1 * bread + 3 * meat + 7 * beer &lt;= capacity) . We want to maximize the total popularity of the rations that are selected: . $$max 3 times bread + 10 times meat + 26 times beer$$ . model.Maximize(3 * bread + 10 * meat + 26 * beer) . The model is complete, CP-SAT can solve the problem! . status = solver.Solve(model) # If an optimal solution has been found, print results if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL: print(&#39;================= Solution =================&#39;) print(f&#39;Solved in {solver.WallTime():.2f} milliseconds&#39;) print() print(f&#39;Optimal value = {3*solver.Value(bread)+10*solver.Value(meat)+26*solver.Value(beer)} popularity&#39;) print(&#39;Food:&#39;) print(f&#39; - ü•ñBread = {solver.Value(bread)}&#39;) print(f&#39; - ü•©Meat = {solver.Value(meat)}&#39;) print(f&#39; - üç∫Beer = {solver.Value(beer)}&#39;) else: print(&#39;The solver could not find an optimal solution.&#39;) . ================= Solution ================= Solved in 0.01 milliseconds Optimal value = 68 popularity Food: - ü•ñBread = 2 - ü•©Meat = 1 - üç∫Beer = 2 . We obtained the highest popularity (68) possible with a capacity of 19. . Is the constraint respected? Let&#39;s quickly check it: 1√ó2ü•ñ + 3√ó1ü•© + 7√ó2üç∫ = 19, which is indeed ‚â§ 19. . Okay, I&#39;d like to ask another question: how many solutions to this problem are there? Once again, we can answer it with a specific callback to count them. . class CountSolutions(cp_model.CpSolverSolutionCallback): &quot;&quot;&quot;Count the number of solutions.&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self): cp_model.CpSolverSolutionCallback.__init__(self) self.__solution_count = 0 def on_solution_callback(self): self.__solution_count += 1 def solution_count(self): return self.__solution_count solution_printer = CountSolutions() # Instantiate model and solver model = cp_model.CpModel() solver = cp_model.CpSolver() # 1. Variables capacity = 19 bread = model.NewIntVar(0, capacity, &#39;Bread&#39;) meat = model.NewIntVar(0, capacity, &#39;Meat&#39;) beer = model.NewIntVar(0, capacity, &#39;Beer&#39;) # 2. Constraints model.Add(1 * bread + 3 * meat + 7 * beer &lt;= capacity) # Print results solver.parameters.enumerate_all_solutions = True status = solver.Solve(model, solution_printer) print(solution_printer.solution_count()) . 121 . We found 121 solutions with a capacity of 19. But this number quickly increases: with a capacity of 1000, there are 8,080,104 possible solutions! And yet, CP-SAT finds the optimal solution in less than a second. How is it possible? . CP solvers do not brute force the problem with an exhaustive search, but combine heuristics and combinatorial search instead. More specifically, the three most popular techniques for constraint satisfaction problems are backtracking, constraint propagation, and local search). . CP-SAT is quite particular since it combines CP and SAT: it is part of a broader trend of merging CP, LP, SAT, and metaheuristics. . We said that the previous problem could be solved with Linear Programming, so let&#39;s compare the code of both solutions: . As you can see, the syntax is quite similar but it&#39;s not the same: model/solver vs. solver, NewIntVar instead of IntVar, etc. There&#39;s a bit of translation to do, but it&#39;s easily manageable. . These two techniques are incredibly close to each other: they both handle variables with constraints and perform optimization using math and heuristics. However, CP is limited to discrete parameters, while LP handles continuous ones. On the other hand, you can implement specialized constraints like &quot;all different&quot; in CP, but not in LP. Here is a summary of the main differences between these two technologies: . If you want to know more about this topic, I would recommend this article by Irvin J. Lustig and Jean-Fran√ßois Puget. CPLEX&#39;s documentation also details the differences at this address, in terms of modeling and optimization. . Conclusion . Constraint Programming is another incredible technique in the mathematical optimization toolbox. It is a radically different approach compared to traditional, declarative programming. In this article, . We saw two applications of CP with satisfiability and optimization; | We implemented CP models in OR-Tools and played with the callback function; | We highlighted the differences between CP and LP. | . We limited ourselves to simple problems in this introduction, but CP has amazing applications in complex scheduling and routing problems. This is a topic I&#39;d love to address in a future article. . If you&#39;re interested to know more about it, feel free to follow me on Twitter @maximelabonne.

            "title": "GIN: How to Design the Most Powerful Graph Neural Network",
            "content": "Graph Neural Networks are not limited to classifying nodes. . One of the most popular applications is graph classification. This is a common task when dealing with molecules: they are represented as graphs and features about each atom (node) can be used to predict the behavior of the entire molecule. . However, GNNs only learn node embeddings. How to combine them in order to produce an entire graph embedding? In this article, we will: . See a new type of layer, called &quot;global pooling&quot;, to combine node embeddings; . | Introduce a new architecture called Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), designed by Xu et al. in 2018. . | . We&#39;ll detail the advantages of GIN in terms of discriminative power compared to a GCN or GraphSAGE, and its connection to the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Beyond its powerful aggregator, GIN brings exciting takeaways about GNNs in general. . You can run the code with the following Google Colab notebook. . import torch torchversion = torch.__version__ # Install PyTorch Scatter, PyTorch Sparse, and PyTorch Geometric !pip install -q torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-{torchversion}.html !pip install -q torch-sparse -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-{torchversion}.html !pip install -q git+https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric.git # Visualization import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.rcParams[&#39;figure.dpi&#39;] = 300 plt.rcParams.update({&#39;font.size&#39;: 24}) . &#127760; I. PROTEINS dataset . 3D plot of a protein by DeepMind.PROTEINS is a popular dataset in bioinformatics. It is a collection of 1113 graphs representing proteins, where nodes are amino acids. Two nodes are connected by an edge when they are close enough (&lt; 0.6 nanometers). The goal is to classify each protein as an enzyme or not. . Enzymes are a particular type of proteins that act as catalysts to speed up chemical reactions in the cell. They are essential for digestion (e.g., lipases), respiration (e.g., oxidases), and other crucial functions of the human body. They are also used in commercial applications, like the production of antibiotics. . This dataset is also available on TUDataset and implemented in PyTorch Geometric. . from torch_geometric.datasets import TUDataset dataset = TUDataset(root=&#39;.&#39;, name=&#39;PROTEINS&#39;).shuffle() # Print information about the dataset print(f&#39;Dataset: {dataset}&#39;) print(&#39;-&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of graphs: {len(dataset)}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of nodes: {dataset[0].x.shape[0]}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of features: {dataset.num_features}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of classes: {dataset.num_classes}&#39;) . Dataset: PROTEINS(1113) - Number of graphs: 1113 Number of nodes: 117 Number of features: 3 Number of classes: 2 . I&#39;m not a biochemist so I&#39;m curious about these proteins. Let&#39;s plot one as a graph to see what it looks like. . from torch_geometric.utils import to_networkx from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D import numpy as np G = to_networkx(dataset[2], to_undirected=True) # 3D spring layout pos = nx.spring_layout(G, dim=3, seed=0) # Extract node and edge positions from the layout node_xyz = np.array([pos[v] for v in sorted(G)]) edge_xyz = np.array([(pos[u], pos[v]) for u, v in G.edges()]) # Create the 3D figure fig = plt.figure(figsize=(16,16)) ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection=&quot;3d&quot;) # Suppress tick labels for dim in (ax.xaxis, ax.yaxis, ax.zaxis): dim.set_ticks([]) # Plot the nodes - alpha is scaled by &quot;depth&quot; automatically ax.scatter(*node_xyz.T, s=500, c=&quot;#0A047A&quot;) # Plot the edges for vizedge in edge_xyz: ax.plot(*vizedge.T, color=&quot;tab:gray&quot;) # fig.tight_layout() plt.show() . The previous 3D structure is randomly generated: obtaining the correct 3D representation is a problem so difficult it&#39;s the whole point of AlphaFold. . Graphs are not the only way to represent molecules. The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) is another popular method, which uses a line (string) notation. It is obtained by printing the nodes encountered in a depth-first tree traversal of a slightly modified molecular graph. . Researchers often use this representation when working with molecules or chemical compounds. Fortunately for us, the PROTEINS dataset is already encoded in the form of graphs. Otherwise, we could have to translate the SMILES strings into networkx graphs. . It doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ll directly feed the PROTEINS dataset to our GNN. If GraphSAGE taught us anything, it&#39;s that mini-batching is incredibly efficient. It is now an indispensable tool whenever we implement a GNN. . from torch_geometric.loader import DataLoader # Create training, validation, and test sets train_dataset = dataset[:int(len(dataset)*0.8)] val_dataset = dataset[int(len(dataset)*0.8):int(len(dataset)*0.9)] test_dataset = dataset[int(len(dataset)*0.9):] print(f&#39;Training set = {len(train_dataset)} graphs&#39;) print(f&#39;Validation set = {len(val_dataset)} graphs&#39;) print(f&#39;Test set = {len(test_dataset)} graphs&#39;) # Create mini-batches train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True) val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True) test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=False) print(&#39; nTrain loader:&#39;) for i, subgraph in enumerate(train_loader): print(f&#39; - Subgraph {i}: {subgraph}&#39;) print(&#39; nValidation loader:&#39;) for i, subgraph in enumerate(val_loader): print(f&#39; - Subgraph {i}: {subgraph}&#39;) print(&#39; nTest loader:&#39;) for i, subgraph in enumerate(test_loader): print(f&#39; - Subgraph {i}: {subgraph}&#39;) .

PROTEINS is not a huge dataset, but mini-batching will speed up the training nonetheless. We could use a GCN or a GAT, but there&#39;s a new architecture I&#39;d like to introduce: the Graph Isomorphism Network. . &#127870; II. Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) . GIN was designed by researchers trying to maximize the representational (or discriminative) power of a GNN. But how do you define a &quot;representational power&quot;? . A. Weisfeiler-Lehman test . A way to characterize the &quot;power&quot; of a GNN is to use the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test. Isomorphic graphs mean that they have the same structure: identical connections but a permutation of nodes. The WL test is able to tell if two graphs are non-isomorphic, but it cannot guarantee that they are isomorphic. . Two isomorphic graphs.This might not seem like much, but it can be extremely difficult to tell two large graphs apart. In fact, this problem is not known to be solvable in polynomial time, nor to be NP-complete. It might even be somewhere in between, in the computational complexity class NP-intermediate (if it only exists). . Okay, but how is it related to GNNs? Some researchers in graph learning noticed that this test and the way GNNs learn are oddly similar. In the WL test, . Every node starts with the same label; | Labels from neighboring nodes are aggregated and hashed to produce a new label; | The previous step is repeated until the labels stop changing. | If you&#39;re interested in the WL test, I would recommend this blog post by David Bieber and this article by Michael Bronstein. . Not only this test is similar to how feature vectors are aggregated in GNNs, but its ability to tell graphs apart makes it more powerful than a lot of architectures, including GCNs and GraphSAGE. This is what inspired Xu et al. to design a new aggregator that is proven to be as good as the WL test. . B. One aggregator to rule them all . To be as good as the WL test, this new aggregator must produce different node embeddings when dealing with non-isomorphic graphs. . We&#39;ll skip the math-heavy part of the paper, but the solution they found is to use two injective functions. Which ones? We don&#39;t know, we can just learn them with a MLP! . With GATs, we used a neural network to learn the best weighting factors for a given task; | With GINs, we now learn the approximation of two injective functions thanks to the Universal Approximation Theorem. | . Here&#39;s how to calculate the hidden vector of a particular node $i$ with GIN: . $$h_i = MLP bigg((1+…õ) cdot x_i + sum_{j in mathcal{N}_i}x_j bigg)$$ . In this formula, $…õ$ determines the importance of the target node compared to its neighbors (it has the same importance if $…õ = 0$). It can be a learnable parameter or a fixed scalar. . Note that we talk about MLPs to highlight the fact there is more than one layer. According to the authors, one layer is not sufficient for graph learning in general. . C. Global pooling . Global pooling or graph-level readout consists of producing a graph embedding using the node embeddings calculated by the GNN. . A simple way to obtain a graph embedding $h_G$ is to use the mean, sum, or max of every node embedding $h_i$: . $${Mean}: h_G = frac{1}{N} sum_{i=0}^N h_i {Sum}: h_G = sum_{i=0}^N h_i {Max}: h_G = {max}_{i=0}^N(h_i)$$The authors make two important points about graph-level readout: . To consider all structural information, it is necessary to keep embeddings from previous layers; | The sum operator is surprisingly more expressive than the mean and the max. | . These observations lead them to propose the following global pooling method: . $$h_G = sum_{i=0}^N{h_i^0} || dots || sum_{i=0}^N{h_i^k} $$ . For each layer, embeddings nodes are summed and the result is concatenated. This solution combines the expressiveness of the sum operator with the memory of previous iterations from the concatenation. . &#129504; III. GIN in PyTorch Geometric . It is always interesting to see the differences between the original design and its implementations. . There is a GINConv layer in PyTorch Geometric with different parameters: . nn: the MLP that is used to approximate our two injective functions; | eps: the initial value of $…õ$, which is 0 by default; | train_eps: a True/False statement to determine if $…õ$ is trainable, which is False by default. | . You can see that $…õ$ is entirely removed by default in this implementation: it&#39;s a hyperparameter we can tune, but probably not an essential one. . There is a second GIN layer in PyTorch Geometric, called GINEConv. It comes from this paper&#39;s implementation of GIN, which applies a $ReLU$ function to the neighbors&#39; features. We won&#39;t use it in this tutorial, since the benefits are not clear. . We still need to design a MLP for the GINConv layer. Here&#39;s the design we&#39;ll implement, inspired by the original paper: . The paper stacks 5 layers but we&#39;ll be more humble with 3 layers instead. Here is what the entire architecture looks like: . I could not find any implementation of GIN with graph embedding concatenation, so here is my version (it improves the accuracy by 1% on average). Let&#39;s compare it to a GCN with a simple mean pooling (and no concatenation). . from torch.nn import Linear, Sequential, BatchNorm1d, ReLU, Dropout import torch.nn.functional as F from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv, GINConv from torch_geometric.nn import global_mean_pool, global_add_pool class GCN(torch.nn.Module): &quot;&quot;&quot;GCN&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, dim_h): super(GCN, self).__init__() self.conv1 = GCNConv(dataset.num_node_features, dim_h) self.conv2 = GCNConv(dim_h, dim_h) self.conv3 = GCNConv(dim_h, dim_h) self.lin = Linear(dim_h, dataset.num_classes) def forward(self, x, edge_index, batch): # Node embeddings h = self.conv1(x, edge_index) h = h.relu() h = self.conv2(h, edge_index) h = h.relu() h = self.conv3(h, edge_index) # Graph-level readout hG = global_mean_pool(h, batch) # Classifier h = F.dropout(hG, p=0.5, training=self.training) h = self.lin(h) return hG, F.log_softmax(h, dim=1) class GIN(torch.nn.Module): &quot;&quot;&quot;GIN&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, dim_h): super(GIN, self).__init__() self.conv1 = GINConv( Sequential(Linear(dataset.num_node_features, dim_h), BatchNorm1d(dim_h), ReLU(), Linear(dim_h, dim_h), ReLU())) self.conv2 = GINConv( Sequential(Linear(dim_h, dim_h), BatchNorm1d(dim_h), ReLU(), Linear(dim_h, dim_h), ReLU())) self.conv3 = GINConv( Sequential(Linear(dim_h, dim_h), BatchNorm1d(dim_h), ReLU(), Linear(dim_h, dim_h), ReLU())) self.lin1 = Linear(dim_h*3, dim_h*3) self.lin2 = Linear(dim_h*3, dataset.num_classes) def forward(self, x, edge_index, batch): # Node embeddings h1 = self.conv1(x, edge_index) h2 = self.conv2(h1, edge_index) h3 = self.conv3(h2, edge_index) # Graph-level readout h1 = global_add_pool(h1, batch) h2 = global_add_pool(h2, batch) h3 = global_add_pool(h3, batch) # Concatenate graph embeddings h = torch.cat((h1, h2, h3), dim=1) # Classifier h = self.lin1(h) h = h.relu() h = F.dropout(h, p=0.5, training=self.training) h = self.lin2(h) return h, F.log_softmax(h, dim=1) gcn = GCN(dim_h=32) gin = GIN(dim_h=32) . def train(model, loader): criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss() optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=0.01) epochs = 100 model.train() for epoch in range(epochs+1): total_loss = 0 acc = 0 val_loss = 0 val_acc = 0 # Train on batches for data in loader: optimizer.zero_grad() _, out = model(data.x, data.edge_index, data.batch) loss = criterion(out, data.y) total_loss += loss / len(loader) acc += accuracy(out.argmax(dim=1), data.y) / len(loader) loss.backward() optimizer.step() # Validation val_loss, val_acc = test(model, val_loader) # Print metrics every 10 epochs if(epoch % 10 == 0): print(f&#39;Epoch {epoch:&gt;3} | Train Loss: {total_loss:.2f} &#39; f&#39;| Train Acc: {acc*100:&gt;5.2f}% &#39; f&#39;| Val Loss: {val_loss:.2f} &#39; f&#39;| Val Acc: {val_acc*100:.2f}%&#39;) test_loss, test_acc = test(model, test_loader) print(f&#39;Test Loss: {test_loss:.2f} | Test Acc: {test_acc*100:.2f}%&#39;) return model def test(model, loader): criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss() model.eval() loss = 0 acc = 0 for data in loader: _, out = model(data.x, data.edge_index, data.batch) loss += criterion(out, data.y) / len(loader) acc += accuracy(out.argmax(dim=1), data.y) / len(loader) return loss, acc def accuracy(pred_y, y): &quot;&quot;&quot;Calculate accuracy.&quot;&quot;&quot; return ((pred_y == y).sum() / len(y)).item() gcn = train(gcn, train_loader) gin = train(gin, train_loader) . Epoch 100 | Train Loss: 0.67 | Train Acc: 60.61% | Val Loss: 0.70 | Val Acc: 54.50% Test Loss: 0.69 | Test Acc: 55.99% Epoch 100 | Train Loss: 0.49 | Train Acc: 75.61% | Val Loss: 0.53 | Val Acc: 78.99% Test Loss: 0.60 | Test Acc: 66.93% . This time, there&#39;s no competition! . The GIN architecture completely outperforms the GCN. This gap (10% accuracy on average) is due to several reasons: . GIN&#39;s aggregator is specifically designed to discriminate graphs that the GCN&#39;s aggregator cannot; | Graph hidden vectors from every layer are concatenated instead of only considering the last one; | The sum operator is superior to the mean operator (at least in theory). | . Let&#39;s visualize the proteins we classified with the GCN and the GIN. . fig, ax = plt.subplots(4, 4, figsize=(16,16)) fig.suptitle(&#39;GCN - Graph classification&#39;) for i, data in enumerate(dataset[1113-16:]): # Calculate color (green if correct, red otherwise) _, out = gcn(data.x, data.edge_index, data.batch) color = &quot;green&quot; if out.argmax(dim=1) == data.y else &quot;red&quot; # Plot graph ix = np.unravel_index(i, ax.shape) ax[ix].axis(&#39;off&#39;) G = to_networkx(dataset[i], to_undirected=True) nx.draw_networkx(G, pos=nx.spring_layout(G, seed=0), with_labels=False, node_size=150, node_color=color, width=0.8, ax=ax[ix] ) . fig, ax = plt.subplots(4, 4, figsize=(16,16)) fig.suptitle(&#39;GIN - Graph classification&#39;) for i, data in enumerate(dataset[1113-16:]): # Calculate color (green if correct, red otherwise) _, out = gin(data.x, data.edge_index, data.batch) color = &quot;green&quot; if out.argmax(dim=1) == data.y else &quot;red&quot; # Plot graph ix = np.unravel_index(i, ax.shape) ax[ix].axis(&#39;off&#39;) G = to_networkx(dataset[i], to_undirected=True) nx.draw_networkx(G, pos=nx.spring_layout(G, seed=0), with_labels=False, node_size=150, node_color=color, width=0.8, ax=ax[ix] ) . Interestingly enough, the two models make different mistakes. This is a common result in machine learning when different algorithms are applied to the same problem. . We can take advantage of this behavior by creating an ensemble. There are many ways of combining our graph embeddings. The simplest method is to take the mean of the normalized output vectors. . gcn.eval() gin.eval() acc_gcn = 0 acc_gin = 0 acc = 0 for data in test_loader: # Get classifications _, out_gcn = gcn(data.x, data.edge_index, data.batch) _, out_gin = gin(data.x, data.edge_index, data.batch) out = (out_gcn + out_gin)/2 # Calculate accuracy scores acc_gcn += accuracy(out_gcn.argmax(dim=1), data.y) / len(test_loader) acc_gin += accuracy(out_gin.argmax(dim=1), data.y) / len(test_loader) acc += accuracy(out.argmax(dim=1), data.y) / len(test_loader) # Print results print(f&#39;GCN accuracy: {acc_gcn*100:.2f}%&#39;) print(f&#39;GIN accuracy: {acc_gin*100:.2f}%&#39;) print(f&#39;GCN+GIN accuracy: {acc*100:.2f}%&#39;) . GCN accuracy: 55.99% GIN accuracy: 66.93% GCN+GIN accuracy: 67.45% . This time, we&#39;re lucky enough to see the accuracy improved. . Obviously, it&#39;s not always the case. More sophisticated methods involve building an entirely different ML algorithm for classification, such as a Random Forest. This classifier takes graph embeddings as inputs and outputs the final classification. . Conclusion . Graph Isomorphism Networks are an important step in the understanding of GNNs. . They not only improve the accuracy scores on several benchmarks but also provide a theoretical framework to explain why one architecture is better than another. In this article, . We saw a new task with graph classification, performed with global pooling; | We introduced the WL test and its connection with the new GIN layer; | We implemented a GIN and a GCN and made an simple ensemble with their classifications. | . Although GINs achieve good performance, especially with social graphs, their theoretical superiority doesn&#39;t always translate well in the real world. It is true with other &quot;provably powerful&quot; architectures, which tend to underperform in practice, such as the 3WLGNN. .

They both use GraphSAGE to power their recommender system on a massive scale: millions and billions of nodes and edges. . üñºÔ∏è Pinterest developed its own version called PinSAGE to recommend the most relevant images (pins) to its users. Their graph has 18 billion connections and 3 billion nodes. | üçΩÔ∏è UberEats also reported using a modified version of GraphSAGE to suggest dishes, restaurants, and cuisines. UberEats claims to support more than 600,000 restaurants and 66 million users. Meanwhile, it keeps recommending me tacos that gave me food poisoning. | . In this tutorial, we‚Äôll use a dataset with 20k nodes instead of billions because Google Colab cannot handle our ambitions. We will stick to the original GraphSAGE architecture, but the previous variants also bring interesting features that we will comment on. . You can run the code with the following Google Colab notebook. . import torch torchversion = torch.__version__ # Install PyTorch Scatter, PyTorch Sparse, and PyTorch Geometric !pip install -q torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-{torchversion}.html !pip install -q torch-sparse -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-{torchversion}.html !pip install -q git+https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric.git # Visualization import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.rcParams[&#39;figure.dpi&#39;] = 300 plt.rcParams.update({&#39;font.size&#39;: 24}) . &#127760; I. PubMed dataset . As we saw in the previous article, PubMed is part of the Planetoid dataset (MIT license). Here&#39;s a quick summary: . It contains 19,717 scientific publications about diabetes from PubMed&#39;s database; | Node features are TF-IDF weighted word vectors with 500 dimensions, which is a pretty cool way of summarizing documents without transformers; | The task is quite straightforward since it&#39;s a multi-class classification with three categories: diabetes mellitus experimental, diabetes mellitus type 1, and diabetes mellitus type 2. | . This is the beauty and the curse of deep learning: I don‚Äôt know anything about diabetes, but I‚Äôll still feel pretty satisfied if we reach 70% accuracy. At least, we‚Äôre not building the next IBM Watson. . from torch_geometric.datasets import Planetoid dataset = Planetoid(root=&#39;.&#39;, name=&quot;Pubmed&quot;) data = dataset[0] # Print information about the dataset print(f&#39;Dataset: {dataset}&#39;) print(&#39;-&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of graphs: {len(dataset)}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of nodes: {data.x.shape[0]}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of features: {dataset.num_features}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of classes: {dataset.num_classes}&#39;) # Print information about the graph print(f&#39; nGraph:&#39;) print(&#39;&#39;) print(f&#39;Training nodes: {sum(data.train_mask).item()}&#39;) print(f&#39;Evaluation nodes: {sum(data.val_mask).item()}&#39;) print(f&#39;Test nodes: {sum(data.test_mask).item()}&#39;) print(f&#39;Edges are directed: {data.is_directed()}&#39;) print(f&#39;Graph has isolated nodes: {data.has_isolated_nodes()}&#39;) print(f&#39;Graph has loops: {data.has_self_loops()}&#39;) .

As we can see, PubMed has an insanely low number of training nodes compared to the full graph. There are only 60 samples to learn how to classify the 1000 test nodes. . Despite this challenge, GNNs manage to obtain high levels of accuracy. Here‚Äôs the leaderboard of known techniques (a more complete benchmark can be found on PapersWithCode): . Model üìùPubMed (accuracy) . Multilayer Perceptron | 71.4% | . Graph Convolutional Network | 79.0% | . Graph Attention Network | 79.0% | . GraphSAGE | ??? | . I couldn‚Äôt find any result for GraphSAGE on PubMed with this specific setting (60 training nodes, 1000 test nodes), so I don‚Äôt expect a great accuracy. But another metric can be just as relevant when working with large graphs: training time. . &#129497;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039; II. GraphSAGE in theory . The GraphSAGE algorithm can be divided into two steps: . Beighbor sampling; | Aggregation. | &#127920; A. Neighbor sampling . Mini-batching is a common technique used in machine learning. . It works by breaking down a dataset into smaller batches, which allows us to train models more effectively. Mini-batching has several benefits: . Improved accuracy ‚Äî mini-batches help to reduce overfitting (gradients are averaged), as well as variance in error rates; | Increased speed ‚Äî mini-batches are processed in parallel and take less time to train than larger batches; | Improved scalability ‚Äî an entire dataset can exceed the GPU memory, but smaller batches can get around this limitation. | Mini-batching is so useful it became standard in regular neural networks. However, it is not as straightforward with graph data, since splitting the dataset into smaller chunks would break essential connections between nodes. ‚ùå . So, what can we do? In recent years, researchers developed different strategies to create graph mini-batches. The one we&#39;re interested in is called 6neighbor sampling). There are many other techniques you can find on PyG&#39;s documentation, such as subgraph clustering). . &lt;/source&gt; Neighbor sampling considers only a fixed number of random neighbors. Here‚Äôs the process: . We define the number of neighbors (1 hop), the number of neighbors of neighbors (2 hops), etc. we would like to have. | The sampler looks at the list of neighbors, of neighbors of neighbors, etc. of a target node and randomly selects a predefined number of them; | The sampler outputs a subgraph containing the target node and the randomly selected neighboring nodes. | This process is repeated for every node in a list or the entirety of the graph. However, creating a subgraph for each node is not efficient, that is why we can process them in batches instead. In this case, each subgraph is shared by multiple target nodes. . Neighbor sampling has an added benefit. Sometimes, we observe extremely popular nodes that act like hubs, such as celebrities on social media. Obtaining the hidden vectors of these nodes can be computationally very expensive since it requires calculating the hidden vectors of thousands or even millions of neighbors. GraphSAGE fixes this issue by simply ignoring most of the nodes! . In PyG, neighbor sampling is implemented through the NeighborLoader object. Let&#39;s say we want 5 neighbors and 10 of their neighbors (num_neighbors). As we discussed, we can also specify a batch_size to speed up the process by creating subgraphs for multiple target nodes. . from torch_geometric.loader import NeighborLoader from torch_geometric.utils import to_networkx # Create batches with neighbor sampling train_loader = NeighborLoader( data, num_neighbors=[5, 10], batch_size=16, input_nodes=data.train_mask, ) # Print each subgraph for i, subgraph in enumerate(train_loader): print(f&#39;Subgraph {i}: {subgraph}&#39;) # Plot each subgraph fig = plt.figure(figsize=(16,16)) for idx, (subdata, pos) in enumerate(zip(train_loader, [&#39;221&#39;, &#39;222&#39;, &#39;223&#39;, &#39;224&#39;])): G = to_networkx(subdata, to_undirected=True) ax = fig.add_subplot(pos) ax.set_title(f&#39;Subgraph {idx}&#39;) plt.axis(&#39;off&#39;) nx.draw_networkx(G, pos=nx.spring_layout(G, seed=0), with_labels=True, node_size=200, node_color=subdata.y, cmap=&quot;cool&quot;, font_size=10 ) plt.show() . Subgraph 0: Data(x=[389, 500], edge_index=[2, 448], y=[389], train_mask=[389], val_mask=[389], test_mask=[389], batch_size=16) Subgraph 1: Data(x=[264, 500], edge_index=[2, 314], y=[264], train_mask=[264], val_mask=[264], test_mask=[264], batch_size=16) Subgraph 2: Data(x=[283, 500], edge_index=[2, 330], y=[283], train_mask=[283], val_mask=[283], test_mask=[283], batch_size=16) Subgraph 3: Data(x=[189, 500], edge_index=[2, 229], y=[189], train_mask=[189], val_mask=[189], test_mask=[189], batch_size=12) . We created 4 subgraphs of various sizes. It allows us to process them in parallel and they&#39;re easier to fit on a GPU since they&#39;re smaller. . The number of neighbors is an important parameter since pruning our graph removes a lot of information. How much, exactly? Well, quite a lot. We can visualize this effect by looking at the node degrees (number of neighbors). . from torch_geometric.utils import degree from collections import Counter def plot_degree(data): # Get list of degrees for each node degrees = degree(data.edge_index[0]).numpy() # Count the number of nodes for each degree numbers = Counter(degrees) # Bar plot fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 6)) ax.set_xlabel(&#39;Node degree&#39;) ax.set_ylabel(&#39;Number of nodes&#39;) plt.bar(numbers.keys(), numbers.values(), color=&#39;#0A047A&#39;) # Plot node degrees from the original graph plot_degree(data) # Plot node degrees from the last subgraph plot_degree(subdata) . In this example, the maximum node degree of our subgraphs is 5, which is much lower than the original max value. It‚Äôs important to remember this tradeoff when talking about GraphSAGE. . PinSAGE implements another sampling solution using random walks. It has two main objectives: . Sample a fixed number of neighbors (like GraphSAGE); | Obtain their relative importance (important nodes are seen more frequently than others). | This strategy feels a bit like a fast attention mechanism. It assigns weights to nodes and increases the relevance of the most popular ones. . &#128165; B. Aggregation . The aggregation process determines how to combine the feature vectors to produce the node embeddings. The original paper presents three ways of aggregating features: . Mean aggregator | LSTM aggregator | Pooling aggregator | . &lt;/source&gt; The mean aggregator is the simplest one. The idea is close to a GCN approach: . The hidden features of the target node $ textbf{h}_v$ are concatenated with the hidden features of its neighbors $ textbf{h}_u$; | The resulting vector is averaged; | A linear transformation with a weight matrix $ textbf{W}$ is applied. | $$ textbf{h}_v&#39; = textbf{W} cdot mean([ textbf{h}_v|| textbf{h}_u])$$ . The result can then be fed to a non-linear activation function $ sigma$ (like $tanh$ or $ReLU$). This is the technique we&#39;ll use with PyG and the one selected by UberEats. . The LSTM aggregator can seem like a weird idea because this architecture is sequential: it assigns an order to our unordered nodes. This is why the authors randomly shuffle them to force the LSTM to only consider the hidden features. It is the best performing technique in their benchmarks. . The pooling aggregator feeds each neighbor&#39;s hidden vector to a feedforward neural network. A max-pooling operation is applied to the result. . &#129504; III. GraphSAGE in PyTorch Geometric . We can easily implement a GraphSAGE architecture in PyTorch Geometric with the SAGEConv layer. This implementation is not exactly the same as in the paper since it uses 2 matrices instead of one: . $$ textbf{h}_v&#39; = textbf{W}_1 textbf{h}_v + textbf{W}_2 cdot mean( textbf{h}_u)$$ . Let&#39;s create a network with two SAGEConv layers: . The first one uses $ReLU$ as the activation function and a dropout layer; | The second one directly outputs the node embeddings. | . As we&#39;re dealing with a*multi-class classification** task, we&#39;ll use the cross-entropy loss as our loss function. . To see the benefits of GraphSAGE, let&#39;s compare it with a GCN and a GAT without any sampling. . from torch.nn import Linear, Dropout from torch_geometric.nn import SAGEConv, GATv2Conv, GCNConv import torch.nn.functional as F class GraphSAGE(torch.nn.Module): &quot;&quot;&quot;GraphSAGE&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, dim_in, dim_h, dim_out): super().__init__() self.sage1 = SAGEConv(dim_in, dim_h) self.sage2 = SAGEConv(dim_h, dim_out) self.optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=5e-4) def forward(self, x, edge_index): h = self.sage1(x, edge_index) h = torch.relu(h) h = F.dropout(h, p=0.5, training=self.training) h = self.sage2(h, edge_index) return h, F.log_softmax(h, dim=1) def fit(self, data, epochs): criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss() optimizer = self.optimizer self.train() for epoch in range(epochs+1): total_loss = 0 acc = 0 val_loss = 0 val_acc = 0 # Train on batches for batch in train_loader: optimizer.zero_grad() _, out = self(batch.x, batch.edge_index) loss = criterion(out[batch.train_mask], batch.y[batch.train_mask]) total_loss += loss acc += accuracy(out[batch.train_mask].argmax(dim=1), batch.y[batch.train_mask]) loss.backward() optimizer.step() # Validation val_loss += criterion(out[batch.val_mask], batch.y[batch.val_mask]) val_acc += accuracy(out[batch.val_mask].argmax(dim=1), batch.y[batch.val_mask]) # Print metrics every 10 epochs if(epoch % 10 == 0): print(f&#39;Epoch {epoch:&gt;3} | Train Loss: {total_loss/len(train_loader):.3f} &#39; f&#39;| Train Acc: {acc/len(train_loader)*100:&gt;6.2f}% | Val Loss: &#39; f&#39;{val_loss/len(train_loader):.2f} | Val Acc: &#39; f&#39;{val_acc/len(train_loader)*100:.2f}%&#39;) class GAT(torch.nn.Module): &quot;&quot;&quot;Graph Attention Network&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, dim_in, dim_h, dim_out, heads=8): super().__init__() self.gat1 = GATv2Conv(dim_in, dim_h, heads=heads) self.gat2 = GATv2Conv(dim_h*heads, dim_out, heads=heads) self.optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=0.005, weight_decay=5e-4) def forward(self, x, edge_index): h = F.dropout(x, p=0.6, training=self.training) h = self.gat1(x, edge_index) h = F.elu(h) h = F.dropout(h, p=0.6, training=self.training) h = self.gat2(h, edge_index) return h, F.log_softmax(h, dim=1) def fit(self, data, epochs): criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss() optimizer = self.optimizer self.train() for epoch in range(epochs+1): # Training optimizer.zero_grad() _, out = self(data.x, data.edge_index) loss = criterion(out[data.train_mask], data.y[data.train_mask]) acc = accuracy(out[data.train_mask].argmax(dim=1), data.y[data.train_mask]) loss.backward() optimizer.step() # Validation val_loss = criterion(out[data.val_mask], data.y[data.val_mask]) val_acc = accuracy(out[data.val_mask].argmax(dim=1), data.y[data.val_mask]) # Print metrics every 10 epochs if(epoch % 10 == 0): print(f&#39;Epoch {epoch:&gt;3} | Train Loss: {loss:.3f} | Train Acc:&#39; f&#39; {acc*100:&gt;6.2f}% | Val Loss: {val_loss:.2f} | &#39; f&#39;Val Acc: {val_acc*100:.2f}%&#39;) class GCN(torch.nn.Module): &quot;&quot;&quot;Graph Convolutional Network&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, dim_in, dim_h, dim_out): super().__init__() self.gcn1 = GCNConv(dim_in, dim_h) self.gcn2 = GCNConv(dim_h, dim_out) self.optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=5e-4) def forward(self, x, edge_index): h = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training) h = self.gcn1(h, edge_index) h = torch.relu(h) h = F.dropout(h, p=0.5, training=self.training) h = self.gcn2(h, edge_index) return h, F.log_softmax(h, dim=1) def fit(self, data, epochs): criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss() optimizer = self.optimizer self.train() for epoch in range(epochs+1): # Training optimizer.zero_grad() _, out = self(data.x, data.edge_index) loss = criterion(out[data.train_mask], data.y[data.train_mask]) acc = accuracy(out[data.train_mask].argmax(dim=1), data.y[data.train_mask]) loss.backward() optimizer.step() # Validation val_loss = criterion(out[data.val_mask], data.y[data.val_mask]) val_acc = accuracy(out[data.val_mask].argmax(dim=1), data.y[data.val_mask]) # Print metrics every 10 epochs if(epoch % 10 == 0): print(f&#39;Epoch {epoch:&gt;3} | Train Loss: {loss:.3f} | Train Acc:&#39; f&#39; {acc*100:&gt;6.2f}% | Val Loss: {val_loss:.2f} | &#39; f&#39;Val Acc: {val_acc*100:.2f}%&#39;) def accuracy(pred_y, y): &quot;&quot;&quot;Calculate accuracy.&quot;&quot;&quot; return ((pred_y == y).sum() / len(y)).item() def test(model, data): &quot;&quot;&quot;Evaluate the model on test set and print the accuracy score.&quot;&quot;&quot; model.eval() _, out = model(data.x, data.edge_index) acc = accuracy(out.argmax(dim=1)[data.test_mask], data.y[data.test_mask]) return acc .

The three models obtain similar results in terms of accuracy. We expect the GAT to perform better because its aggregation mechanism is more nuanced, but it‚Äôs not always the case. . The real difference is the training time: GraphSAGE is 88 times faster than the GAT and 4 times faster than the GCN in this example! . Here lies the true power of GraphSAGE. We do lose a lot of information by pruning our graph with neighbor sampling. The final node embeddings might not be as good as what we could find with a GCN or a GAT. But this is not the point: GraphSAGE is designed to improve scalability. In turn, it can lead to building larger graphs that can improve accuracy. . This work was done in a supervised training setting (node classification), but we could also train GraphSAGE in an unsupervised way. . In this case, we can‚Äôt use the cross-entropy loss. We have to engineer a loss function that forces nodes that are nearby in the original graph to remain close to each other in the embedding space. Conversely, the same function must ensure that distant nodes in the graph must have distant representations in the embedding space. This is the loss that is presented in GraphSAGE‚Äôs paper. . In the case of PinSAGE and UberEeats‚Äô modified GraphSAGE, we‚Äôre dealing with recommender systems. . The goal is to correctly rank the most relevant items (pins, restaurants) for each user, which is very different. We don‚Äôt only want to know what the closest embeddings are, we have to produce the best rankings possible. This is why these systems are also trained in an unsupervised way, but with another loss function: a max-margin ranking loss. . Conclusion . GraphSAGE is an incredibly fast architecture to process large graphs. It might not be as accurate as a GCN or a GAT, but it is an essential model when dealing with a massive amount of data. It delivers this speed thanks to a clever combination of 1/ neighbor sampling to prune the graph and 2/ fast aggregation with a mean aggregator in this example. In this article, . We explored a new dataset with PubMed, which is several times larger than the previous one; | We explained the idea behind neighbor sampling, which only considers a predefined number of random neighbors at each hop; | We saw the three aggregators presented in GraphSAGE&#39;s paper and focused on the mean aggregator; | We benchmarked three models (GraphSAGE, GAT, and GCN) in terms of accuracy and training time. | . We saw three architectures with the same end application: node classification. But GNNs have been successfully applied to other tasks. In the next tutorials, I‚Äôd like to use them in two different contexts: graph and edge prediction. This will be a good way to discover new datasets and applications where GNNs dominate the state of the art. .

            "title": "What is a Tensor in Deep Learning?",
            "content": "What is a tensor, exactly? . Most deep learning practitioners know about them but can&#39;t pinpoint an exact definition. . TensorFlow, PyTorch: every deep learning framework relies on the same basic object: tensors. They&#39;re used to store almost everything in deep learning: input data, weights, biases, predictions, etc. . And yet, their definition is incredibly fuzzy: the Wikipedia category alone has over 100 pages related to tensors. . In this article, we&#39;ll give a definitive answer to the following question: what is a tensor in neural networks? . &#128187; Tensors in computer science . So why are there so many definitions? . It&#39;s quite simple: different fields have different definitions. Tensors in mathematics are not quite the same as tensors in physics, which are different from tensors in computer science. . These definitions can be divided into two categories: tensors as a data structure or as objects (in an object-oriented programming sense). . Data structure: this is the definition we use in computer science. Tensors are multidimensional arrays that store a specific type of value. | Objects: this is the definition used in other fields. In mathematics and physics, tensors are not just a data structure: they also have a list of properties, like a specific product. | . This is why you see a lot of people (sometimes quite pedantically) saying &quot;tensors are not n-dimensional arrays/matrices&quot;: they don&#39;t talk about data structures, but about objects with properties. . Even the same words have different meanings. For instance, in computer science, a 2D tensor is a matrix (it&#39;s a tensor of rank 2). In linear algebra, a tensor with 2 dimensions means it only stores two values. The rank also has a completely different definition: it is the maximum number of its linearly independent column (or row) vectors. . In computer science, we&#39;re only interested in a definition focused on the data structure. From this point of view, tensors truly are a generalization in $n$ dimensions of matrices. . But we&#39;re still missing an important nuance when talking about tensors specifically in the context of deep learning... . &#129504; Tensors in deep learning . Icons created by Freepik and smashingstocks - FlaticonSo why are they called &quot;tensors&quot; instead of &quot;multidimensional arrays&quot;? Ok, it is shorter, but is it all there is to it? Actually, people make an implicit assumption when they talk about tensors. . PyTorch&#39;s official documentation gives us a practical answer: . The biggest difference between a numpy array and a PyTorch Tensor is that a PyTorch Tensor can run on either CPU or GPU. . In deep learning, we need performance to compute a lot of matrix multiplications in a highly parallel way. These matrices (and n-dimensional arrays in general) are generally stored and processed on GPUs to speed up training and inference times. . This is what was missing in our previous definition:tensors in deep learning are not just n-dimensional arrays, there&#39;s also the implicit assumption they can be run on a GPU. . &#9876;&#65039; NumPy vs PyTorch . Let&#39;s see the difference between NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors. . These two objects are very similar: we can initialize a 1D array and a 1D tensor with nearly the same syntax. They also share a lot of methods and can be easily converted into one another. . You can find the code used in this article at this address . import numpy as np import torch array = np.array([1, 2, 3]) print(f&#39;NumPy Array: {array}&#39;) tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3]) print(f&#39;PyTorch Tensor: {tensor}&#39;) . NumPy Array: [1 2 3] PyTorch Tensor: tensor([1, 2, 3]) . Initializing 2D arrays and 2D tensors is not more complicated. . x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) print(f&#39;NumPy Array: n{x}&#39;) x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) print(f&#39; nPyTorch Tensor: n{x}&#39;) . NumPy Array: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] PyTorch Tensor: tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) . We said that the only difference between tensors and arrays was the fact that tensors can be run on GPUs. So in the end, this distinction is based on performance. But is this boost that important? . Let&#39;s compare the performance between NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors on matrix multiplication. In the following example, we randomly initialize 4D arrays/tensors and multiply them. . device = torch.device(&quot;cuda&quot;) # 4D arrays array1 = np.random.rand(100, 100, 100, 100) array2 = np.random.rand(100, 100, 100, 100) # 4D tensors tensor1 = torch.rand(100, 100, 100, 100).to(device) tensor2 = torch.rand(100, 100, 100, 100).to(device) . %%timeit np.matmul(array1, array2) . 1 loop, best of 5: 1.32 s per loop . %%timeit torch.matmul(tensor1, tensor2) . 1000 loops, best of 5: 25.2 ms per loop . As we can see, PyTorch tensors completed outperformed NumPy arrays: they completed the multiplication 52 times faster! . This is the true power of tensors: they&#39;re blazingly fast! Performance might vary depending on the dimensions, the implementation, and the hardware, but this speed is the reason why tensors (and not arrays) are so common in deep learning. . &#128221; Conclusion . In this article, we wrote a definition of tensors based on: . Their use in computer science (data structure); | More specifically, in deep learning (they can run on GPUs). | Here&#39;s how we can summarize it in one sentence: . Tensors are n-dimensional arrays with the implicit assumption that they can run on a GPU. . Finally, we saw the difference in performance between tensors and arrays, which motivates the need for tensors in deep learning. . So next time someone tries to explain to you that tensors are not exactly a generalization of matrices, you&#39;ll know that they&#39;re right in a particular definition of tensors, but not in the computer science/deep learning one. .

It&#39;s all well and good, but the way I did it was horribly inefficient. I had to wait several minutes to do the most basic operations. .

Each row describes a connection between two computers. . Let&#39;s say we want to create a new feature: the total number of bytes in the connection. We just have to sum up two existing features: src_bytes and dst_bytes. Let&#39;s see different methods to calculate this new feature. . &#10060;&#10060; 1. Iterrows . According to the official documentation, iterrows() iterates &quot;over the rows of a Pandas DataFrame as (index, Series) pairs&quot;. It converts each row into a Series object, which causes two problems: . It can change the type of your data (dtypes); | The conversion greatly degrades performance. | For these reasons, the ill-named iterrows() is the WORST possible method to actually iterate over rows. . %%timeit -n 10 # Iterrows total = [] for index, row in df.iterrows(): total.append(row[&#39;src_bytes&#39;] + row[&#39;dst_bytes&#39;]) . 10 loops, best of 5: 1.07 s per loop . Now let&#39;s see slightly better techniques... . &#10060; 2. For loop with .loc or .iloc (3&#215; faster) . This is what I used to do when I started: a basic for loop to select rows by index (with .loc or .iloc). . Why is it bad? Because DataFrames are not designed for this purpose. As with the previous method, rows are converted into Pandas Series objects, which degrades performance. . Interestingly enough, .iloc is faster than .loc. It makes sense since Python doesn&#39;t have to check user-defined labels and directly look at where the row is stored in memory. . %%timeit -n 10 # For loop with .loc total = [] for index in range(len(df)): total.append(df[&#39;src_bytes&#39;].loc[index] + df[&#39;dst_bytes&#39;].loc[index]) . 10 loops, best of 5: 600 ms per loop . %%timeit -n 10 # For loop with .iloc total = [] for index in range(len(df)): total.append(df[&#39;src_bytes&#39;].iloc[index] + df[&#39;dst_bytes&#39;].iloc[index]) . 10 loops, best of 5: 377 ms per loop . Even this basic for loop with .iloc is 3 times faster than the first method! . &#10060; 3. Apply (4&#215; faster) . The apply() method is another popular choice to iterate over rows. It creates code that is easy to understand but at a cost: performance is nearly as bad as the previous for loop. . This is why I would strongly advise you to avoid this function for this specific purpose (it&#39;s fine for other applications). . Note that I convert the DataFrame into a list using the to_list() method to obtain identical results. . %%timeit -n 10 # Apply df.apply(lambda row: row[&#39;src_bytes&#39;] + row[&#39;dst_bytes&#39;], axis=1).to_list() . 10 loops, best of 5: 282 ms per loop . The apply() method is a for loop in disguise, which is why the performance doesn&#39;t improve that much: it&#39;s only 4 times faster than the first technique. . &#10060; 4. Itertuples (10&#215; faster) . If you know about iterrows(), you probably know about itertuples(). According to the official documentation, it iterates &quot;over the rows of a DataFrame as namedtuples of the values&quot;. In practice, it means that rows are converted into tuples, which are much lighter objects than Pandas Series. . This is why itertuples() is a better version of iterrows(). This time, we need to access the values with an attribute (or an index). If you want to access them with a string (e.g., if there&#39;s a space in the string), you can use the getattr() function instead. . %%timeit -n 10 # Itertuples total = [] for row in df.itertuples(): total.append(row.src_bytes + row.dst_bytes) . 10 loops, best of 5: 99.3 ms per loop . This is starting to look better: it is now 10 times faster than iterrows(). . &#10060; 5. List comprehensions (200&#215; faster) . List comprehensions are a fancy way to iterate over a list as a one-liner. . For instance, [print(i) for i in range(10)] prints numbers from 0 to 9 without any explicit for loop. I say &quot;explicit&quot; because Python actually processes it as a for loop if we look at the bytecode. . So why is it faster? Quite simply because we don&#39;t call the .append() method in this version. . %%timeit -n 100 # List comprehension [src + dst for src, dst in zip(df[&#39;src_bytes&#39;], df[&#39;dst_bytes&#39;])] . 100 loops, best of 5: 5.54 ms per loop . Indeed, this technique is 200 times faster than the first one! But we can still do better. . &#9989; 6. Pandas vectorization (1500&#215; faster) . Until now, all the techniques used simply add up single values. Instead of adding single values, why not group them into vectors to sum them up? The difference between adding two numbers or two vectors is not significant for a CPU, which should speed things up. . On top of that, Pandas can process Series objects in parallel, using every CPU core available! . The syntax is also the simplest imaginable: this solution is extremely intuitive. Under the hood, Pandas takes care of vectorizing our data with an optimized C code using contiguous memory blocks. . %%timeit -n 1000 # Vectorization (df[&#39;src_bytes&#39;] + df[&#39;dst_bytes&#39;]).to_list() . 1000 loops, best of 5: 734 ¬µs per loop . This code is 1500 times faster than iterrows() and it is even simpler to write. . &#9989;&#9989; 7. NumPy vectorization (1900&#215; faster) . NumPy is designed to handle scientific computing. It has less overhead than Pandas methods since rows and dataframes all become np.array. It relies on the same optimizations as Pandas vectorization. . There are two ways of converting a Series into a np.array: using .values or .to_numpy(). The former has been deprecated for years, which is why we&#39;re gonna use .to_numpy() in this example. . %%timeit -n 1000 # Numpy vectorization (df[&#39;src_bytes&#39;].to_numpy() + df[&#39;dst_bytes&#39;].to_numpy()).tolist() . 1000 loops, best of 5: 575 ¬µs per loop . We found our winner with a technique that is 1900 times faster than our first competitor! Let&#39;s wrap things up. . &#127942; Conclusion . Don&#39;t be like me: if you need to iterate over rows in a DataFrame, vectorization is the way to go! You can find the code to reproduce the experiments at this address. Vectorization is not harder to read, it doesn&#39;t take longer to write, and the performance gain is incredible. . It&#39;s not just about performance: understanding how each method works under the hood helped me to write better code. Performance gains are always based on the same techniques: transforming data into vectors and matrices to take advantage of parallel processing. Alas, this is often at the expense of readability. But it doesn&#39;t have to be. . Iterating over rows is just an example but it shows that, sometimes, you can have the cake and eat it. üéÇ . If you liked this article, follow me on Twitter @maximelabonne for more tips about data science and machine learning! . &#128200; Bonus . We can measure the performance of each method depending on the size of the DataFrame. I reimplemented all of them in this dummy example using perfplot to show that the leaderboard might be different under 300 rows. Anyway, such a dataset would be so small that we wouldn&#39;t need much optimization. . !pip install -q perfplot import perfplot import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.rcParams.update({&#39;font.size&#39;: 22}) # Techniques def forloop(df): total = [] for index in range(len(df)): total.append(df[&#39;col1&#39;].iloc[index] + df[&#39;col2&#39;].iloc[index]) return total def itertuples(df): total = [] for row in df.itertuples(): total.append(row[1] + row[2]) return total def iterrows(df): total = [] for index, row in df.iterrows(): total.append(row[&#39;col1&#39;] + row[&#39;col2&#39;]) return total def apply(df): return df.apply(lambda row: row[&#39;col1&#39;] + row[&#39;col2&#39;], axis=1).to_list() def comprehension(df): return [src + dst for src, dst in zip(df[&#39;col1&#39;], df[&#39;col2&#39;])] def pd_vectorize(df): return (df[&#39;col1&#39;] + df[&#39;col2&#39;]).to_list() def np_vectorize(df): return (df[&#39;col1&#39;].to_numpy() + df[&#39;col2&#39;].to_numpy()).tolist() # Perfplot functions = [iterrows, forloop, apply, itertuples, comprehension, pd_vectorize, np_vectorize] df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;col1&#39;: [1, 2], &#39;col2&#39;: [3, 4]}) out = perfplot.bench( setup=lambda n: pd.concat([df]*n, ignore_index=True), kernels=functions, labels=[str(f.__name__) for f in functions], n_range=[2**n for n in range(20)], xlabel=&#39;Number of rows&#39;, ) plt.figure(figsize=(20,12)) out.show() . . .

            "content": "Graph Attention Networks are one of the most popular types of Graph Neural Networks. For a good reason. . With Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), every neighbor has the same importance. Obviously, it should not be the case: some nodes are more essential than others. . Node 4 is more important than node 3, which is more important than node 2Graph Attention Networks offer a solution to this problem. To consider the importance of each neighbor, an attention mechanism assigns a weighting factor to every connection. . In this article, we‚Äôll see how to calculate these attention scores and implement an efficient GAT in PyTorch Geometric (PyG). You can run the code of this tutorial with the following Google Colab notebook. . import torch torchversion = torch.__version__ # Install PyTorch Scatter, PyTorch Sparse, and PyTorch Geometric !pip install -q torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-{torchversion}.html !pip install -q torch-sparse -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-{torchversion}.html !pip install -q git+https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric.git # Numpy for matrices import numpy as np np.random.seed(0) # Visualization import networkx as nx from sklearn.manifold import TSNE import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.rcParams[&#39;figure.dpi&#39;] = 300 plt.rcParams.update({&#39;font.size&#39;: 24}) . &#127760; I. Graph data . CiteSeer datasetThere are three classic graph datasets we can use for this work (MIT license). They represent networks of research papers, where each connection is a citation. . Cora: it consists of 2708 machine learning papers that belong to one of 7 categories. ‚û°Ô∏è Node features represent the presence (1) or absence (0) of 1433 words in a paper (binary bag of words). | CiteSeer: it is a bigger but similar dataset of 3312 scientific papers to classify into one of 6 categories. ‚û°Ô∏è Node features represent the presence (1) or absence (0) of 3703 words in a paper. | PubMed: it is an even bigger dataset with 19717 scientific publications about diabetes from PubMed‚Äôs database, classified into 3 categories. ‚û°Ô∏è Node features are TF-IDF weighted word vector from a dictionary of 500 unique words. | . These datasets have been widely used by the scientific community. As a challenge, we can compare our accuracy scores to those obtained in the literature using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), GCNs, and GATs: . Dataset üìùCora üìùCiteSeer üìùPubMed . MLP | 55.1% | 46.5% | 71.4% | . GCN | 81.5% | 70.3% | 79.0% | . GAT | 83.0% | 72.5% | 79.0% | . PubMed is quite large so it would take longer to process it and train a GNN on it. Cora is the most studied one in the literature, so let‚Äôs focus on CiteSeer as a middle ground. . We can directly import any of these datasets in PyTorch Geometric with the Planetoid class: . from torch_geometric.datasets import Planetoid # Import dataset from PyTorch Geometric dataset = Planetoid(root=&quot;.&quot;, name=&quot;CiteSeer&quot;) # Print information about the dataset print(f&#39;Number of graphs: {len(dataset)}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of nodes: {dataset[0].x.shape[0]}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of features: {dataset.num_features}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of classes: {dataset.num_classes}&#39;) print(f&#39;Has isolated nodes: {dataset[0].has_isolated_nodes()}&#39;) . Number of graphs: 1 Number of nodes: 3327 Number of features: 3703 Number of classes: 6 Has isolated nodes: True . Interestingly enough, we have 3327 nodes instead of 3312. I found that PyG actually uses this paper&#39;s implementation of CiteSeer, which also displays 3327 nodes. Mystery solved for now. . However, we observe that some nodes are isolated (48 to be precise)! Correctly classifying these isolated nodes will be a challenge since we cannot rely on any aggregation. . Let‚Äôs plot the number of connections of each node with degree: . from torch_geometric.utils import degree from collections import Counter # Get list of degrees for each node degrees = degree(dataset[0].edge_index[0]).numpy() # Count the number of nodes for each degree numbers = Counter(degrees) # Bar plot fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(18, 6)) ax.set_xlabel(&#39;Node degree&#39;) ax.set_ylabel(&#39;Number of nodes&#39;) plt.bar(numbers.keys(), numbers.values(), color=&#39;#0A047A&#39;) . &lt;BarContainer object of 32 artists&gt; . Most nodes only have 1 or 2 neighbors. It could explain why CiteSeer obtains lower accuracy scores than the two other datasets‚Ä¶ . &#9888;&#65039; II. Self-attention . Introduced by Veliƒçkoviƒá et al. in 2017, self-attention in GNNs relies on a simple idea: nodes should not all have the same importance. . We talk about self-attention (and not just attention) because inputs are compared to each other. . This mechanism assigns a weighting factor (attention score) to each connection. Let‚Äôs call $ alpha_{ij}$ the attention score between the nodes $i$ and $j$. . Here‚Äôs how to calculate the embedding of node 1, where $ mathbf{W}$ is a shared weight matrix: . $$h_i = sum_{j in mathcal{N}_i} dfrac{1}{ sqrt{deg(i)} sqrt{deg(j)}} mathbf{W} x_j$$ . But how do we calculate the attention scores? We could write a static formula, but there‚Äôs a smarter solution: we can learn their values with a neural network. There are three steps in this process: . Linear transformation; | Activation function; | Softmax normalization. | 1&#65039;&#8419; Linear transformation . We want to calculate the importance of each connection, so we need pairs of hidden vectors. An easy way to create these pairs is to concatenate vectors from both nodes. . Only then can we apply a new linear transformation with a weight matrix $W_{att}$: . $$a_{ij} = W_{att}^t[ mathbf{W}x_i mathbin Vert mathbf{W}x_j]) tag{1}$$ . 2&#65039;&#8419; Activation function . We‚Äôre building a neural network, so the second step is to add an activation function. In this case, the authors of the paper chose the LeakyReLU function. . $$e_{ij} = LeakyReLU(a_{ij}) tag{2}$$ . 3&#65039;&#8419; Softmax normalization . The output of our neural network is not normalized, which is a problem since we want to compare these scores. To be able to say if node 2 is more important to node 1 than node 3 ($ alpha_{12} &gt; alpha_{13}$), we need to share the same scale. . A common way to do it with neural networks is to use the softmax function. Here, we apply it to every neighboring node: . $$ alpha_{ij} = softmax_j(e_{ij}) = frac{exp(e_{ij})}{ sum_{k in mathcal{N}_i}{exp(e_{ik})}} tag{3}$$ . Here you have it: we can calculate every $ alpha_{ij}$. The only problem is... self-attention is not very stable. In order to improve performance, Vaswani et al. introduced multi-head attention in the transformer architecture. . 4&#65039;&#8419; Bonus: multi-head attention . This is only slightly surprising since we‚Äôve been talking about self-attention a lot but, in reality, transformers are GNNs in disguise. This is why we can reuse some ideas from Natural Language Processing here. . Multi-head attentionIn GATs, multi-head attention consists of replicating the same 3 steps several times in order to average or concatenate the results. That‚Äôs it. Instead of a single $h_1$, we get one $h_1^k$ per attention head. One of the two following schemes can then be applied: . Average: we sum the different $h_i^k$ and normalize the result by the number of attention heads $n$; | . $$h_i = frac{1}{n} sum_{k=1}^n{h_i^k}$$ . Concatenation: we concatenate the different $h_i^k$. | . $$h_i = mathbin Vert_{k=1}^n{h_i^k}$$ . In practice, we use the concatenation scheme when it‚Äôs a hidden layer, and the average scheme when it‚Äôs the last layer of the network. . &#129504; III. Graph Attention Networks . Let‚Äôs implement a GAT in PyTorch Geometric. This library has two different graph attention layers: GATConv and GATv2Conv. . What we talked about so far is the GatConv layer, but in 2021 Brody et al. introduced an improvement by modifying the order of operations. The weight matrix $ mathbf{W}$ is applied after the concatenation and the attention weight matrix $W_{att}$ after the $LeakyReLU$ function. In summary: . GatConv: $e_{ij} = LeakyReLU(W_{att}^t[ mathbf{W}x_i mathbin Vert mathbf{W}x_j])$ | Gatv2Conv: $e_{ij} = W_{att}^tLeakyReLU( mathbf{W}[x_i mathbin Vert x_j])$ | . Which one should you use? According to Brody et al., Gatv2Conv consistently outperforms GatConv and thus should be preferred. . Now let‚Äôs classify the papers from CiteSeer! I tried to roughly reproduce the experiments of the original authors without adding too much complexity. You can find the official implementation of GAT on GitHub. . Note that we use graph attention layers in two configurations: . The first layer concatenates 8 outputs (multi-head attention); | The second layer only has 1 head, which produces our final embeddings. | .

This experiment is not super rigorous: we‚Äôd need to repeat it $n$ times and take the average accuracy with a standard deviation as the final result. . We can see in this example that the GAT outperforms the GCN in terms of accuracy (70.00% vs. 67.70%), but takes longer to train (55.9s vs. 32.4s). It‚Äôs a tradeoff that can cause scalability issues when working with large graphs. . The authors obtained 72.5% for the GAT and 70.3% for the GCN, which is clearly better than what we did. The difference can be explained by preprocessing, some tweaks in the models, and a different training setting (e.g., a patience of 100 instead of a fixed number of epochs). . Let‚Äôs visualize what the GAT learned. We‚Äôre gonna use t-SNE, a powerful method to plot high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D. First, let‚Äôs see what the embeddings looked like before any training: it should be absolutely random since they‚Äôre produced by randomly initialized weight matrices. . untrained_gat = GAT(dataset.num_features, 8, dataset.num_classes) # Get embeddings h, _ = untrained_gat(data.x, data.edge_index) # Train TSNE tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, learning_rate=&#39;auto&#39;, init=&#39;pca&#39;).fit_transform(h.detach()) # Plot TSNE plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10)) plt.axis(&#39;off&#39;) plt.scatter(tsne[:, 0], tsne[:, 1], s=50, c=data.y) plt.show() . /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/sklearn/manifold/_t_sne.py:986: FutureWarning: The PCA initialization in TSNE will change to have the standard deviation of PC1 equal to 1e-4 in 1.2. This will ensure better convergence. FutureWarning, . Indeed, there&#39;s no apparent structure. But do the embeddings produced by our trained model look better? . h, _ = gat(data.x, data.edge_index) # Train TSNE tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, learning_rate=&#39;auto&#39;, init=&#39;pca&#39;).fit_transform(h.detach()) # Plot TSNE plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10)) plt.axis(&#39;off&#39;) plt.scatter(tsne[:, 0], tsne[:, 1], s=50, c=data.y) plt.show() . /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/sklearn/manifold/_t_sne.py:986: FutureWarning: The PCA initialization in TSNE will change to have the standard deviation of PC1 equal to 1e-4 in 1.2. This will ensure better convergence. FutureWarning, . The difference is noticeable: nodes belonging to the same classes cluster together. We can see 6 clusters, corresponding to the 6 classes of papers. There are outliers, but this was to be expected: our accuracy score is far from perfect. . Previously, I speculated that poorly connected nodes might negatively impact performance on CiteSeer. Let‚Äôs calculate the model‚Äôs accuracy for each degree. . from torch_geometric.utils import degree # Get model&#39;s classifications _, out = gat(data.x, data.edge_index) # Calculate the degree of each node degrees = degree(data.edge_index[0]).numpy() # Store accuracy scores and sample sizes accuracies = [] sizes = [] # Accuracy for degrees between 0 and 5 for i in range(0, 6): mask = np.where(degrees == i)[0] accuracies.append(accuracy(out.argmax(dim=1)[mask], data.y[mask])) sizes.append(len(mask)) # Accuracy for degrees &gt; 5 mask = np.where(degrees &gt; 5)[0] accuracies.append(accuracy(out.argmax(dim=1)[mask], data.y[mask])) sizes.append(len(mask)) # Bar plot fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(18, 9)) ax.set_xlabel(&#39;Node degree&#39;) ax.set_ylabel(&#39;Accuracy score&#39;) ax.set_facecolor(&#39;#EFEEEA&#39;) plt.bar([&#39;0&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;3&#39;,&#39;4&#39;,&#39;5&#39;,&#39;&gt;5&#39;], accuracies, color=&#39;#0A047A&#39;) for i in range(0, 7): plt.text(i, accuracies[i], f&#39;{accuracies[i]*100:.2f}%&#39;, ha=&#39;center&#39;, color=&#39;#0A047A&#39;) for i in range(0, 7): plt.text(i, accuracies[i]//2, sizes[i], ha=&#39;center&#39;, color=&#39;white&#39;) . These results confirm our intuition: nodes with few neighbors are indeed harder to classify. This is due to the nature of GNNs: the more relevant connections you have, the more information you can aggregate. . Conclusion . While they take longer to train, GATs are a substantial improvement over GCNs in terms of accuracy. The self-attention mechanism automatically calculates weighting factors instead of static coefficients to produce better embeddings. In this article, . We learned about the self-attention mechanism applied to GNNs; | We implemented and compared two architectures (a GCN and a GAT) in PyTorch Geometric; | We visualized how and what the GAT learns with a t-SNE plot and the accuracy score for each degree. | . GATs are the de facto standard in a lot of GNN applications. However, their slow training time can become a problem when applied to massive graph datasets. Scalability is an important factor in deep learning: most often, more data can lead to better performance. . In the next article, we‚Äôll see how to improve scalability with mini-batching and a new GNN architecture called GraphSAGE. .

            "title": "Integer vs. Linear Programming in Python",
            "content": "Why is linear programming called that way? . Both terms are confusing: . Linear implies that nonlinear programming exists; | Programming actually means &quot;planning&quot; in this context. | . In summary, it has nothing to do with code: linear or not. It&#39;s about optimizing variables with various constraints. . In this article, we&#39;re gonna talk about another type of optimization: integer programming. We&#39;ll see why a good understanding of the problem we face is necessary to choose the right solver. Finally, we will write a model that can take on a bigger challenge and actually solve a whole class of optimization problems. . You can run the code from this tutorial with the following Google Colab notebook. . &#128202; I. Optimization problem&#160;types . In the introduction to linear programming, we optimized an army composition. Here was the result: . ================= Solution ================= Solved in 87.00 milliseconds in 2 iterations Optimal power = 1800.0 üí™power Army: - üó°Ô∏èSwordsmen = 6.0000000000000036 - üèπBowmen = 0.0 - üêéHorsemen = 5.999999999999999 . How can we have 5.999‚Ä¶ horsemen? We specified that our variables should be integers with VarInt. What was wrong with our code? . The problem is not the model but the choice of the solver. . GLOP is a pure linear programming solver. This means that it cannot understand the concept of integers. It is limited to continuous parameters with a linear relationship. . This is the difference between linear programming (LP) and integer linear programming (ILP). In summary, LP solvers can only use real numbers and not integers as variables. So why did we declare our variables as integers if it doesn&#39;t take them into account? . GLOP cannot solve ILP problems, but other solvers can. Actually, a lot of them are mixed integer linear programming (MILP, commonly called MIP) solvers. This means that they can consider both continuous (real numbers) and discrete (integers) variables. A particular case of discrete values is Boolean variables to represent decisions with 0‚Äì1 values. . Other solvers like SCIP or CBC can solve both MILP and MINLP (mixed integer nonlinear programming) problems. Thanks to OR-Tools, we can use the same model and just change the solver to SCIP or CBC. . solver = pywraplp.Solver(&#39;Maximize army power&#39;, pywraplp.Solver.CBC_MIXED_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING) # 1. Create the variables we want to optimize swordsmen = solver.IntVar(0, solver.infinity(), &#39;swordsmen&#39;) bowmen = solver.IntVar(0, solver.infinity(), &#39;bowmen&#39;) horsemen = solver.IntVar(0, solver.infinity(), &#39;horsemen&#39;) # 2. Add constraints for each resource solver.Add(swordsmen*60 + bowmen*80 + horsemen*140 &lt;= 1200) solver.Add(swordsmen*20 + bowmen*10 &lt;= 800) solver.Add(bowmen*40 + horsemen*100 &lt;= 600) # 3. Maximize the objective function solver.Maximize(swordsmen*70 + bowmen*95 + horsemen*230) # Solve problem status = solver.Solve() # If an optimal solution has been found, print results if status == pywraplp.Solver.OPTIMAL: print(&#39;================= Solution =================&#39;) print(f&#39;Solved in {solver.wall_time():.2f} milliseconds in {solver.iterations()} iterations&#39;) print() print(f&#39;Optimal value = {solver.Objective().Value()} üí™power&#39;) print(&#39;Army:&#39;) print(f&#39; - üó°Ô∏èSwordsmen = {swordsmen.solution_value()}&#39;) print(f&#39; - üèπBowmen = {bowmen.solution_value()}&#39;) print(f&#39; - üêéHorsemen = {horsemen.solution_value()}&#39;) else: print(&#39;The solver could not find an optimal solution.&#39;) . ================= Solution ================= Solved in 3.00 milliseconds in 0 iterations Optimal value = 1800.0 üí™power Army: - üó°Ô∏èSwordsmen = 6.0 - üèπBowmen = 0.0 - üêéHorsemen = 6.0 . Strictly speaking, our variables are still floats (type(swordsmen.solution_value()) = float) but we can see that they don&#39;t have weird decimals anymore: the CBC solver really considered them as integers. . In this example, we would generally just round up these values since the error is insignificant. However, it is important to remember to choose the appropriate solver according to the studied problem: . LP for continuous variables; | MIP/MILP for a combination of continuous and discrete variables. | . There are other types such as quadratic (QP) or nonlinear (NLP or MINLP, with an exponential objective function or constraints for instance) problems. They&#39;re applied in different contexts, but follow the same principles as LP or MIP solvers. . &#129521; II. Building a general model . But what if our resources change? Or if the cost of a unit evolved? What if we upgraded horsemen and their power increased? . One of the best perks of OR-Tools is that it uses a general-purpose programming language like Python. Instead of static numbers, we can store our parameters in objects like dictionaries or lists. . The code won&#39;t be as readable, but it becomes much more flexible: actually, it can be so flexible that we can solve an entire class of optimization problems without changing the model (just the parameters). . Let&#39;s transform our input parameters into Python lists and feed them to the solver through a function. . UNITS = [&#39;üó°Ô∏èSwordsmen&#39;, &#39;üèπBowmen&#39;, &#39;üêéHorsemen&#39;] DATA = [[60, 20, 0, 70], [80, 10, 40, 95], [140, 0, 100, 230]] RESOURCES = [1200, 800, 600] def solve_army(UNITS, DATA, RESOURCES): # Create the linear solver using the CBC backend solver = pywraplp.Solver(&#39;Maximize army power&#39;, pywraplp.Solver.CBC_MIXED_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING) # 1. Create the variables we want to optimize units = [solver.IntVar(0, solver.infinity(), unit) for unit in UNITS] # 2. Add constraints for each resource for r, _ in enumerate(RESOURCES): solver.Add(sum(DATA[u][r] * units[u] for u, _ in enumerate(units)) &lt;= RESOURCES[r]) # 3. Maximize the objective function solver.Maximize(sum(DATA[u][-1] * units[u] for u, _ in enumerate(units))) # Solve problem status = solver.Solve() # If an optimal solution has been found, print results if status == pywraplp.Solver.OPTIMAL: print(&#39;================= Solution =================&#39;) print(f&#39;Solved in {solver.wall_time():.2f} milliseconds in {solver.iterations()} iterations&#39;) print() print(f&#39;Optimal value = {solver.Objective().Value()} üí™power&#39;) print(&#39;Army:&#39;) for u, _ in enumerate(units): print(f&#39; - {units[u].name()} = {units[u].solution_value()}&#39;) else: print(&#39;The solver could not find an optimal solution.&#39;) solve_army(UNITS, DATA, RESOURCES) . ================= Solution ================= Solved in 2.00 milliseconds in 0 iterations Optimal value = 1800.0 üí™power Army: - üó°Ô∏èSwordsmen = 6.0 - üèπBowmen = 0.0 - üêéHorsemen = 6.0 . We obtain the same results: our code seems to work. Now let&#39;s change the parameters to tackle a slightly more complex problem. . Imagine we have a lot more resources: üåæ183000, ü™µ90512, and ü™ô80150, so we can also produce a lot more units! This is the new table: . Unit üåæFood ü™µWood ü™ôGold üí™Attack ‚ù§Ô∏èHealth . üó°Ô∏èSwordsman | 60 | 20 | 0 | 6 | 70 | . üõ°Ô∏èMan-at-arms | 100 | 0 | 20 | 12 | 155 | . üèπBowman | 30 | 50 | 0 | 5 | 70 | . ‚ùåCrossbowman | 80 | 0 | 40 | 12 | 80 | . üî´Handcannoneer | 120 | 0 | 120 | 35 | 150 | . üêéHorseman | 100 | 20 | 0 | 9 | 125 | . ‚ôûKnight | 140 | 0 | 100 | 24 | 230 | . üêèBattering ram | 0 | 300 | 0 | 200 | 700 | . üéØSpringald | 0 | 250 | 250 | 30 | 200 | . Notice that we transformed the üí™power into two values: üí™attack and ‚ù§Ô∏èhealth, which is a little more detailed. Health values are higher than attack values, which is why we want to add a weighting factor to make them more comparable. . Let&#39;s take 10 as an example, so $power = 10 times attack + health$. Our objective function becomes: . $$maximize sum_{u in units} (10 times attack + health) cdot u$$ . Adapting our code to this new problem is actually quite simple: we just have to change the input parameters and update the objective function. . UNITS = [ &#39;üó°Ô∏èSwordsmen&#39;, &#39;üõ°Ô∏èMen-at-arms&#39;, &#39;üèπBowmen&#39;, &#39;‚ùåCrossbowmen&#39;, &#39;üî´Handcannoneers&#39;, &#39;üêéHorsemen&#39;, &#39;‚ôûKnights&#39;, &#39;üêèBattering rams&#39;, &#39;üéØSpringalds&#39;, &#39;ü™®Mangonels&#39;, ] DATA = [ [60, 20, 0, 6, 70], [100, 0, 20, 12, 155], [30, 50, 0, 5, 70], [80, 0, 40, 12, 80], [120, 0, 120, 35, 150], [100, 20, 0, 9, 125], [140, 0, 100, 24, 230], [0, 300, 0, 200, 700], [0, 250, 250, 30, 200], [0, 400, 200, 12*3, 240] ] RESOURCES = [183000, 90512, 80150] def solve_army(UNITS, DATA, RESOURCES): # Create the linear solver using the CBC backend solver = pywraplp.Solver(&#39;Maximize army power&#39;, pywraplp.Solver.CBC_MIXED_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING) # 1.

This problem would take a long time for humans to address, but the ILP solver did it in the blink of an eye. Better than that: it also gives us the guarantee that our solution is optimal, which means that our enemy cannot find a better army composition for the same cost! . We could increase the number of units and give billions of resources but you get the picture: it would just take longer to obtain a solution, but it wouldn&#39;t change the problem. . &#9876;&#65039; III. Combining constraints . Now, let&#39;s say we scouted our enemy and know that their army has a üí™power of 1,000,000. We could build a much better army, but our resources are precious and it wouldn&#39;t be very efficient: all we have to do is to build an army with a üí™power higher than 1,000,000 (even 1,000,001 would be enough). . In other words, the total power is now a constraint (üí™ &gt; 1,000,000) instead of the objective to maximize. The new goal is to minimize the resources we need to produce this army. However, we can reuse our input parameters since they didn&#39;t change. . The new constraint can be translated as &quot;the sum of the power of the selected units must be strictly greater than 1,000,000&quot;. . $$ sum_{u in units} (10 times attack + health) cdot u &gt; 1 ,000 ,000$$ . In code, we can loop through our units and resources to design this constraint. . The objective function also has to change. Our goal is to minimize the sum of resources spent to build the army. . $$minimize sum_{u in units} (food + wood + gold) cdot u$$ . Once again, we can loop through our resources to implement it in OR-Tools. . def solve_army(UNITS, DATA, RESOURCES): # Create the linear solver using the CBC backend solver = pywraplp.Solver(&#39;Minimize resource consumption&#39;, pywraplp.Solver.CBC_MIXED_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING) # 1. Create the variables we want to optimize units = [solver.IntVar(0, solver.infinity(), unit) for unit in UNITS] # 2. Add constraints for each resource for r, _ in enumerate(RESOURCES): solver.Add(sum((10 * DATA[u][-2] + DATA[u][-1]) * units[u] for u, _ in enumerate(units)) &gt;= 1000001) # 3.

The solver found an optimal solution: we need to build 371 üêèbattering rams for a total cost of 111,300 ü™µwood. Wait, what if we don&#39;t have that much wood? In the previous section, we only had ü™µ90512: we cannot produce 371 üêèbattering rams. üò± . So is it possible to take these limited resources into account and still try to build the best army? Actually, it&#39;s super easy: we just have to copy/paste the constraints from the previous section. . In this version, we have two types of constraints: . The total power must be greater than 1,000,000; | We cannot spend more than our limited resources. | . def solve_army(UNITS, DATA, RESOURCES): # Create the linear solver using the CBC backend solver = pywraplp.Solver(&#39;Minimize resource consumption&#39;, pywraplp.Solver.CBC_MIXED_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING) # 1. Create the variables we want to optimize units = [solver.IntVar(0, solver.infinity(), unit) for unit in UNITS] # 2. Add constraints for each resource for r, _ in enumerate(RESOURCES): solver.Add(sum((10 * DATA[u][-2] + DATA[u][-1]) * units[u] for u, _ in enumerate(units)) &gt;= 1000001) # Old constraints for limited resources for r, _ in enumerate(RESOURCES): solver.Add(sum(DATA[u][r] * units[u] for u, _ in enumerate(units)) &lt;= RESOURCES[r]) # 3.

Since we now have a limited resource of ü™µwood, the number of üêèbattering rams sadly dropped from 371 to 301. In exchange, we got 681 üõ°Ô∏èmen-at-arms and 1 lost üó°Ô∏èswordsman (welcome to them). . The total cost of the army is 172,100, which is much higher than the 111,300 we previously found (+65% increase) but it truly is the optimal solution under these constraints. It shows that we should produce more wood because these üêè battering rams are extremely cost-efficient! . This example shows how modular LP models can be. It is possible to reuse parts of the code, like constraints, in another model to combine them and solve more complex problems. . &#129504; IV. Linear Programming vs Machine&#160;Learning . Let&#39;s talk about the elephant in the room. Why not use machine learning (in a broad sense) instead of linear programming? It&#39;s not like this problem cannot be solved with a genetic algorithm for instance. . Mathematical optimization is often neglected in favor of machine learning techniques, but both have their merits: . Linear programming can produce an optimal solution in an undetermined amount of time (it can take years), while machine learning can approximate complex functions in no time. | There is no training in LP, but an expert is required to build a mathematical model. Machine learning needs data, but the models can be used as black boxes to solve a problem. | As a rule of thumb, problems that do not have a particular time constraint and/or are not extremely complex can be advantageously solved with linear programming. | . Conclusion . In this tutorial, we dived deeper into our understanding of mathematical optimization. . We talked about solvers and types of optimization problems: LP, MIP, NLP; | We modeled and solved an extremely common optimization problem in an optimal way and generalized our model through a function; | We reframed this problem and merged two sets of constraints to obtain the best army composition for the lowest price; | We compared the pros and cons of linear programming and machine learning. | . There are a lot more problems where optimization can be applied. For instance, how to create school timetables that satisfy everybody&#39;s requirements? How to deliver 1,000 different orders in a minimum amount of time? Where to create a new metro line to maximize its usefulness? . In future articles, we&#39;ll talk about new types of applications for these techniques, including satisfiability and nonlinear problems. . I hope you enjoyed this more advanced article.

            "content": "Linear programming is a technique to optimize any problem with multiple variables and constraints. It&#39;s a simple but powerful tool every data scientist should master. . Imagine you are a strategist recruiting an army. You have: . Three resources: üåæfood, ü™µwood, and ü™ôgold | Three units: üó°Ô∏èswordsmen, üèπbowmen, and üêéhorsemen. | . Horsemen are stronger than bowmen, who are in turn stronger than swordsmen. The following table provides the cost and power of each unit: . Unit üåæFood ü™µWood ü™ôGold üí™Power . üó°Ô∏èSwordsman | 60 | 20 | 0 | 70 | . üèπBowman | 80 | 10 | 40 | 95 | . üêéHorseman | 140 | 0 | 100 | 230 | . Now we have 1200 üåæfood, 800 ü™µwood, and 600 ü™ôgold. How should we maximize the power of our army considering these resources? . We could simply find the unit with the best power/cost ratio, take as many of them as possible, and repeat the process with the other two units. But this &quot;guess and check&quot; solution might not even be optimal... . Now imagine we have millions of units and resources: the previous greedy strategy is likely to completely miss the optimal solution. It is possible to use a machine learning algorithm (e.g., a genetic algorithm) to solve this problem, but we have no guarantee that the solution will be optimal either. . Fortunately for us, there is a method that can solve our problem in an optimal way: linear programming (or linear optimization), which is part of the field of operations research (OR). In this article, we&#39;ll use it to find the best numbers of swordsmen, bowmen, and horsemen to build the army with the highest power possible. . You can run the code from this tutorial with the following Google Colab notebook. . &#129504; I.&#160;Solvers . In Python, there are different libraries for linear programming such as the multi-purposed SciPy, the beginner-friendly PuLP, the exhaustive Pyomo, and many others. . Today, we are going to use Google OR-Tools, which is quite user-friendly, comes with several prepackaged solvers, and has by far the most stars on GitHub. . If the installation doesn&#39;t work, please restart the kernel and try again: it can fail sometimes. ¬Ø _(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø . !python -m pip install --upgrade --user -q ortools . All these libraries have a hidden benefit: they act as interfaces to use the same model with different solvers. Solvers like Gurobi, Cplex, or SCIP have their own APIs, but the models they create are tied to a specific solver. . OR-Tools allows us to use an abstract (and quite pythonic) way of modeling our problems. We can then choose one or several solvers to find an optimal solution. The model we built is thus highly reusable! . &lt;/source&gt; OR-Tools comes with its own linear programming solver, called GLOP (Google Linear Optimization Package). It is an open-source project created by Google&#39;s Operations Research Team and written in C++. . Other solvers are available such as SCIP, an excellent non-commercial solver created in 2005 and updated and maintained to this day. We could also use popular commercial options like Gurobi and Cplex. However, we would need to install them on top of OR-Tools and get the appropriate licenses (which can be quite costly). For now, let&#39;s try GLOP. . from ortools.linear_solver import pywraplp # Create a solver using the GLOP backend solver = pywraplp.Solver(&#39;Maximize army power&#39;, pywraplp.Solver.GLOP_LINEAR_PROGRAMMING) . &#129518; II. Variables . We created an instance of the OR-Tools solver using GLOP. Now, how to use linear programming? The first thing we want to define is the variables we want to optimize. . In our example, we have three variables: the number of üó°Ô∏èswordsmen, üèπbowmen, and üêéhorsemen in the army. OR-Tools accepts three types of variables: . NumVar for continuous variables; | IntVar for integer variables; | BoolVar for boolean variables. | . We&#39;re looking for round numbers of units, so let&#39;s choose IntVar. We then need to specify lower and upper bounds for these variables. We want at least 0 unit, but we don&#39;t really have an upper bound. So we can say that our upper bound is infinity (or any big number we will never reach). It can be written as: . $$0 leq swordsmen &lt; infty 0 leq bowmen &lt; infty 0 leq horsemen &lt; infty$$Let&#39;s translate it into code. Infinity is replaced by solver.infinity() in OR-Tools. Other than that, the syntax is quite straightforward: . swordsmen = solver.IntVar(0, solver.infinity(), &#39;swordsmen&#39;) bowmen = solver.IntVar(0, solver.infinity(), &#39;bowmen&#39;) horsemen = solver.IntVar(0, solver.infinity(), &#39;horsemen&#39;) . &#9939;&#65039; III. Constraints . We defined our variables, but the constraints are just as important. . Perhaps counter-intuitively, adding more constraints helps the solver to find an optimal solution faster. Why is this the case? Think of the solver as a tree: constraints help it trim branches and reduce the search space. . In our case, we have a limited number of resources we can use to produce units. In other words, we can&#39;t spend more resources than we have. For instance, the üåæfood spent to recruit units cannot be higher than 1200. The same is true with ü™µwood (800) and ü™ôgold (600). . According to our table, units have the following costs: . 1 swordsman = üåæ60 + ü™µ20; | 1 bowman = üåæ80 + ü™µ10 + ü™ô40; | 1 horseman = üåæ140 + ü™ô100. | . We can write one constraint per resource as follows: . $$60 times swordsmen + 80 times bowmen + 140 times horsemen leq 1200 20 times swordsmen + 10 times bowmen leq 800 40 times bowmen + 100 times horsemen leq 600$$In OR-Tools, we simply add the constraints to our solver instance with solver.Add(). . solver.Add(swordsmen*60 + bowmen*80 + horsemen*140 &lt;= 1200) # Food solver.Add(swordsmen*20 + bowmen*10 &lt;= 800) # Wood solver.Add(bowmen*40 + horsemen*100 &lt;= 600) # Gold . &#127919; IV. Objective . Now that we have our variables and constraints, we want to define our goal (or objective function). . In linear programming, this function has to be linear (like the constraints), so of the form $ax + by + cz + d$. In our example, the objective is quite clear: we want to recruit the army with the highest power. The table gives us the following power values: . 1 swordsman = üí™70; | 1 bowman = üí™95; | 1 horseman = üí™230. | . Maximizing the power of the army amounts to maximizing the sum of the power of each unit. Our objective function can be written as: . $$max 70 times swordsmen + 95 times bowmen + 230 times horsemen$$ . In general, there are two types of objective functions: maximizing and minimizing. In OR-Tools, we declare this goal with solver.Maximize() or solver.Minimize(). . solver.Maximize(swordsmen*70 + bowmen*95 + horsemen*230) . And we&#39;re done! There are three steps to model any linear optimization problem: . Declaring the variables to optimize with lower and upper bounds; | Adding constraints to these variables; | Defining the objective function to maximize or to minimize. | Now that is clear, we can ask the solver to find an optimal solution for us. . &#129351; V. Optimize! . Calculating the optimal solution is done with solver.Solve(). This function returns a status that can be used to check that the solution is indeed optimal. . Let&#39;s print the highest total power we can get with the best army configuration. . status = solver.Solve() # If an optimal solution has been found, print results if status == pywraplp.Solver.OPTIMAL: print(&#39;================= Solution =================&#39;) print(f&#39;Solved in {solver.wall_time():.2f} milliseconds in {solver.iterations()} iterations&#39;) print() print(f&#39;Optimal power = {solver.Objective().Value()} üí™power&#39;) print(&#39;Army:&#39;) print(f&#39; - üó°Ô∏èSwordsmen = {swordsmen.solution_value()}&#39;) print(f&#39; - üèπBowmen = {bowmen.solution_value()}&#39;) print(f&#39; - üêéHorsemen = {horsemen.solution_value()}&#39;) else: print(&#39;The solver could not find an optimal solution.&#39;) . ================= Solution ================= Solved in 87.00 milliseconds in 2 iterations Optimal power = 1800.0 üí™power Army: - üó°Ô∏èSwordsmen = 6.0000000000000036 - üèπBowmen = 0.0 - üêéHorsemen = 5.999999999999999 . Great! The solver found an optimal solution: our army has a total power of üí™1800 with 6 üó°Ô∏èswordsmen and 6 üêéhorsemen (sorry bowmen!). . Let&#39;s unpack this result: . The solver decided to take the maximum number of üêéhorsemen (6, since we only have ü™ô600 and they each cost ü™ô100); | The remaining resources are spent in üó°Ô∏èswordsmen: we have $1200 ‚Äì 6*140 = 360$üåæfood left, which is why the solver chose 6 üó°Ô∏èswordsmen; | We can deduce that the horsemen are the best unit and the bowmen are the worst one because they haven&#39;t been chosen at all. | . Okay, but there&#39;s something quite weird: these numbers are not round, even though we specified that we wanted integers (IntVar). So what happened? . Unfortunately, answering this question requires a deep dive into linear programming‚Ä¶ To keep things simple in this introduction, let&#39;s say it&#39;s because of GLOP. Solvers have characteristics we have to take into account, and GLOP doesn&#39;t handle integers. This is another proof that building reusable models is more than just convenient. . We&#39;ll explain why GLOP has this strange behavior and how to fix it in a more advanced tutorial. . Conclusion . We saw through this example the five main steps of any linear optimization problem: . Choosing a solver: in our case, we selected GLOP for convenience. | Declaring variables: the parameters to optimize were the number of swordsmen, bowmen, and horsemen. | Declaring constraints: each of these units has a cost. The total cost could not exceed our limited resources. | Defining objective: the criterion to maximize was the total power of this army. It could have been something else, like the number of units. | Optimizing: GLOP found an optimal solution to this problem in less than a second. | This is the main benefit of linear programming: the algorithm gives us a guarantee that the solution that was found is optimal (with a certain error). This guarantee is powerful, but comes at a cost: the model can be so complex that the solver takes years (or more) to find an optimal solution. In this scenario, we have two options: . We can stop the solver after a certain time (and probably obtain a suboptimal answer); | We can use a metaheuristic like a genetic algorithm to calculate an excellent solution in a short amount of time. | . In the next article, we&#39;ll talk about the different types of optimization problems and generalize our approach to an entire class of them. . I hope you enjoyed this introduction!

            "content": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are one of the most interesting architectures in deep learning. In just a few years, they managed to apply neural networks to a whole new set of problems: drug discovery where they found a new antibiotic (Halicin), in Google Maps where they outperform any other method to estimate the time of arrival, and they now even recommend every article, video, or connection you see on all big social media. GNNs are a technology with tremendous potential and countless applications still untapped and yet to be discovered. . Despite these achievements, GNNs are not as widely taught as other architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Because of their young age, educational resources are scarcer and more research-oriented, which can discourage many practitioners. In this article, we&#39;re going to do node classification with graph data using PyTorch Geometric (or PyG). Once we understand how to interact with this specific type of data, we will try to understand the core of GNNs: the message passing layer. Finally, we&#39;ll implement a GNN and visualize how it learns and understands our graph data. . The first step is to install the libraries we&#39;ll need throughout this article. We assume that PyTorch is already installed, which is the case on Google Colab. If you don&#39;t have PyTorch in your environment, please follow the instructions given in the official documentation.

In this article, we&#39;re gonna study the infamous and much-used Zachary&#39;s karate club dataset. It has somewhat of a special aura in the community, and no course about graphs would be complete without it. . Zachary&#39;s karate club simply represents the relationships within a karate club studied by Wayne W. Zachary in the 1970s. It is a kind of social network, where every node is a member, and members who interacted outside the club are connected together. In this example, the club is divided into 4 groups: we would like to assign the right group to every member (node classification) just by looking at their connections. You can see it&#39;s quite similar to friend suggestions on social media, which is another task you can perform with GNNs: link prediction. . Let&#39;s import the dataset with PyG&#39;s built-in function and try to understand the Datasets object it uses. . from torch_geometric.datasets import KarateClub # Import dataset from PyTorch Geometric dataset = KarateClub() # Print information print(dataset) print(&#39;&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of graphs: {len(dataset)}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of features: {dataset.num_features}&#39;) print(f&#39;Number of classes: {dataset.num_classes}&#39;) . KarateClub() Number of graphs: 1 Number of features: 34 Number of classes: 4 . This dataset only has 1 graph, where each node has a feature vector of 34 dimensions and is part of one out of 4 classes (our 4 groups). Actually, the Datasets object can be seen as a collection of Data (graph) objects. We can further inspect our unique graph to know more about it. . print(f&#39;Graph: {dataset[0]}&#39;) . Graph: Data(x=[34, 34], edge_index=[2, 156], y=[34], train_mask=[34]) . The Data object is particularly interesting. Printing it offers a good summary of the graph we&#39;re studying: . x=[34, 34] is the node feature matrix with shape (number of nodes, number of features). In our case, it means that we have 34 nodes (our 34 members), each node being associated to a 34-dim feature vector. | edge_index=[2, 156] represents the graph connectivity (how the nodes are connected) with shape (2, number of directed edges). | y=[34] is the node ground-truth labels. In this problem, every node is assigned to one class (group), so we have one value for each node. | train_mask=[34] is an optional attribute that tells which nodes should be used for training with a list of True or False statements. | . Let&#39;s print each of these parameters to understand what they store. . data = dataset[0] # Print x print(f&#39;x = {data.x.shape}&#39;) print(data.x) . x = torch.Size([34, 34]) tensor([[1., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 1., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 1., ..., 0., 0., 0.], ..., [0., 0., 0., ..., 1., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 1., 0.], [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 1.]]) . Here, the node feature matrix x is actually an identity matrix: it doesn&#39;t contain any relevant information about the nodes. It could contain things like age, skill level, etc. but this is not the case in this dataset. We&#39;ll have to classify our nodes just by looking at their connections. . print(f&#39;edge_index = {data.edge_index.shape}&#39;) print(data.edge_index) . edge_index = torch.Size([2, 156]) tensor([[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 16, 16, 17, 17, 18, 18, 19, 19, 19, 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 22, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 24, 24, 24, 25, 25, 25, 26, 26, 27, 27, 27, 27, 28, 28, 28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30, 30, 30, 30, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33], [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19, 21, 31, 0, 2, 3, 7, 13, 17, 19, 21, 30, 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13, 27, 28, 32, 0, 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 0, 6, 10, 0, 6, 10, 16, 0, 4, 5, 16, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 30, 32, 33, 2, 33, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 33, 32, 33, 32, 33, 5, 6, 0, 1, 32, 33, 0, 1, 33, 32, 33, 0, 1, 32, 33, 25, 27, 29, 32, 33, 25, 27, 31, 23, 24, 31, 29, 33, 2, 23, 24, 33, 2, 31, 33, 23, 26, 32, 33, 1, 8, 32, 33, 0, 24, 25, 28, 32, 33, 2, 8, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, 29, 30, 31, 33, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]]) . The edge_index has a quite counter-intuitive way of storing the graph connectivity. Here, we have 156 directed edges (78 bidirectional edges) twice because the first 156-dim array contains the sources and the second one the destinations. It is called a coordinate list (COO) and is just one way of efficiently storing a sparse matrix. A more intuitive way to represent the graph connectivity would be a simple adjacency matrix $A$, where nodes are rows and columns and 1s indicate a connection between two nodes. . The adjacency matrix can actually be calculated from the edge_index with a utility function. . from torch_geometric.utils import to_dense_adj A = to_dense_adj(data.edge_index)[0].numpy().astype(int) print(f&#39;A = {A.shape}&#39;) print(A) . A = (34, 34) [[0 1 1 ... 1 0 0] [1 0 1 ... 0 0 0] [1 1 0 ... 0 1 0] ... [1 0 0 ... 0 1 1] [0 0 1 ... 1 0 1] [0 0 0 ... 1 1 0]] . Unfortunately, it is not an optimal way of storing this information, since nodes are not highly interconnected. It means that our adjacency matrix is filled with zeros (sparse matrix) to indicate that there&#39;s no connection between nodes. Storing so many zeros is not efficient at all, which is why the COO format is adopted by PyG. . print(f&#39;y = {data.y.shape}&#39;) print(data.y) . y = torch.Size([34]) tensor([1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]) . On the contrary, node ground-truth labels y are quite straightforward: they simply encode the group number (0, 1, 2, 3) for each node. . print(f&#39;train_mask = {data.train_mask.shape}&#39;) print(data.train_mask) . train_mask = torch.Size([34]) tensor([ True, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]) . Finally, the train_mask shows which nodes are supposed to be used for training with True statements. This is not super useful because we don&#39;t have test data anyway... üëÄ . But we&#39;re not done yet! The Data object has a lot more to offer: numerous properties about graphs can be checked using utility functions. For instance, is_directed() can tell you if the graph is directed, which means that all the edges are directed only in one direction. Another useful one is isolated_nodes() to check if some nodes are not connected to the rest of the graph. Finally, has_self_loops() can tell you if at least one node is connected to itself. This is not the same as loops: loops mean that you can take a path that starts and ends at the same node. . print(f&#39;Edges are directed: {data.is_directed()}&#39;) print(f&#39;Graph has isolated nodes: {data.has_isolated_nodes()}&#39;) print(f&#39;Graph has loops: {data.has_self_loops()}&#39;) . Edges are directed: False Graph has isolated nodes: False Graph has loops: False . One of the coolest utility functions available in PyG is to_networkx. It allows you to convert your Data instance into a networkx.Graph to easily visualize it. We can use matplotlib to plot the graph with colors corresponding to the label of every node. . from torch_geometric.utils import to_networkx G = to_networkx(data, to_undirected=True) plt.figure(figsize=(12,12)) plt.axis(&#39;off&#39;) nx.draw_networkx(G, pos=nx.spring_layout(G, seed=0), with_labels=True, node_size=800, node_color=data.y, cmap=&quot;hsv&quot;, vmin=-2, vmax=3, width=0.8, edge_color=&quot;grey&quot;, font_size=14 ) plt.show() . Okay, we plotted the Zachary&#39;s karate club dataset and can visualize our 34 nodes, 78 edges, and 4 labels with 4 different colours. I think our understanding of the problem is now strong enough to talk a bit more about GNNs and their core component: message passing. . &#9993;&#65039; II. Message Passing . 1. Redesigning message passing from convolution . In image processing, filters to blur, sharpen, or detect edges are all based on the same operation: a convolution between a matrix and an image. In the case of a $3 times 3$ matrix, this operation looks at the 8 pixels around each pixel and apply weights to their values. These values can be a single number, or a vector containing multiple numbers. In the previous figure, the same weight is applied to every neighboring pixel: each pixel becomes an average of its neighbors, which is why the result looks blurry. Different filters can be designed just by changing the value of these weights. Now, we could think of each pixel as a node and the entire image as a graph. The operation would be exactly the same. . Why is that relevant? In graphs, similar nodes are more likely to be connected to each other than dissimilar ones (it&#39;s called network homophily). Information about each node is stored in a feature vector, but we can get even more information about a node just by aggregating its features with those of its neighbors. This operation is called convolution for images, and message passing in GNNs. Message passing is a confusing name: the idea behind it is that nodes send &quot;messages&quot; (feature vectors) to each other, but it is just a general framework for neighborhood aggregation. . Let&#39;s take an example: we want to aggregate the feature vectors of the pixel $5$ with those of its 8 neighbors. Usually, pixels contain 3 values to encode the 3 primary colors red, green, and blue, so each feature vector can be noted $x_i = [r_i, g_i, b_i]$. As in a convolution operation, we multiply $x_5$ and the neighboring nodes&#39; feature vectors by a matrix $ mathbf{W}$. Note that in this case, $W_i$ are not single values, but vectors because they have to take into account three values for each $x_i$ ($r_i$, $g_i$, $b_i$). In other words, we have a weight matrix $ mathbf{W}$ containing 9 weight vectors $W_i$. We call the list of pixel $5$ and its neighbors $ mathcal{N}_5 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }$. The result $h_5$ of this aggregation can be calculated as follows: . $$h_5 = W_1x_1 + dots + W_9x_9 = sum_{i in mathcal{N}_5} {W_ix_i}$$ . We could apply the same idea to graphs in general, but there&#39;s a problem: nodes do not have a consistent order like pixels do. If we change the order from $ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }$ to $ {9, 3, 1, 4, 7, 6, 2, 5, 8 }$, we would obtain a different result. It makes sense with images, but nodes can&#39;t be to the left or to the right of other nodes, they don&#39;t have positions! It means that we never know if the nodes are going to be in the correct order, so we can&#39;t assign $W_i$ to $x_i$. Okay then, a simple solution is to reuse the same weight vector $ mathbf{W}$ for every $x_i$, instead of having a unique weight vector $W_i$ for each node. That way, the same operation is performed whatever the node is. The formula now becomes: . $$h_5 = sum_{i in mathcal{N}_5} mathbf{W}x_i$$ . But unlike pixels, nodes do not have a fixed number of neighbors. What if one node only has 1 neighbor, and another one has 500 of them? We would add 500 values instead of just one, which means that the result $h$ would be much larger for the node with 500 neighbors. But it doesn&#39;t make sense: nodes should always be comparable so they need to have a similar range of values. To address this issue, we can normalize the result based on the number of neighbors. In graph theory, this number is called a degree. Let&#39;s divide the result of the previous formula by the number of neighbors of node $5$ (noted $deg(5)$): . $$h_5 = dfrac{1}{deg(5)} sum_{i in mathcal{N}_5} mathbf{W} x_i$$ . Excellent! We now have a message passing layer. There are other types of message passing, but this one is simple and works fairly well. We had to overcome two issues compared to a convolution operation: . Nodes don&#39;t have any idea of order, which forced us to use a common weight $ mathbf{W}$; | Nodes have a variable number of neighbors, which pushed us to normalize our result by dividing it by the number of neighbors $deg(5)$. | 2. (Optional) Message passing with matrices . Naturally, this way of computing message passing node by node is not very efficient. Since we&#39;re talking about neural networks, it means that calculations are performed through matrix multiplication. Let&#39;s go back to our dataset and translate the previous operations into matrices. First, we have data.x, which is the feature node matrix $X$. In this particular dataset, $X$ is the identity matrix $I$ but, in general, it could store any information about the nodes. . # a numpy array with integers instead of floats X = data.x.numpy().astype(int) print(f&#39;X = {X.shape}&#39;) print(X) . X = (34, 34) [[1 0 0 ... 0 0 0] [0 1 0 ... 0 0 0] [0 0 1 ... 0 0 0] ... [0 0 0 ... 1 0 0] [0 0 0 ... 0 1 0] [0 0 0 ... 0 0 1]] . Now we need $W$, the learnable weight matrix (like a filter) of our message passing layer. Our layer is not trained yet, so we can initialize $W$ with arbitrary values. To keep things simple, let&#39;s take the identity matrix again, so $W X = I cdot I = I$. . W = np.identity(X.shape[0], dtype=int) print(f&#39;W = {W.shape}&#39;) print(W) . W = (34, 34) [[1 0 0 ... 0 0 0] [0 1 0 ... 0 0 0] [0 0 1 ... 0 0 0] ... [0 0 0 ... 1 0 0] [0 0 0 ... 0 1 0] [0 0 0 ... 0 0 1]] . We can apply the weights in $W$ to every feature vector by calculating $WX$, but this is not what we want to do! Indeed, we only need to include the neighboring nodes and not every node in the graph. A nice way to find these neighbors is to look at the adjacency matrix $A$ we saw earlier. . print(f&#39;A = {A.shape}&#39;) print(A) . A = (34, 34) [[0 1 1 ... 1 0 0] [1 0 1 ... 0 0 0] [1 1 0 ... 0 1 0] ... [1 0 0 ... 0 1 1] [0 0 1 ... 1 0 1] [0 0 0 ... 1 1 0]] . In our case, $A$ is symmetric because edges in this graph are bidirectional. This wouldn&#39;t be the case if connections were unidirectional. This is why we use $A^T X$ and not $AX$ in general in order to obtain the feature vectors of the neighboring nodes. This operation does not only select the relevant vectors, it also sums them in the process. . &lt;/source&gt; We just miss the &quot;central&quot; node itself, which can be fixed by adding a connection to itself (self-loops) in the adjacency matrix: $ tilde{A} = A + I$. . A_tilde = A + np.identity(A.shape[0], dtype=int) print(f&#39; nA_tilde = {A_tilde.shape}&#39;) print(A_tilde) . A_tilde = (34, 34) [[1 1 1 ... 1 0 0] [1 1 1 ... 0 0 0] [1 1 1 ... 0 1 0] ... [1 0 0 ... 1 1 1] [0 0 1 ... 1 1 1] [0 0 0 ... 1 1 1]] . $ tilde{A}^TX$ selects the feature vectors of the neighboring nodes (and the node itself) and $WX$ applies the weights in $W$ to every feature vector in the graph. We can combine both expressions to apply these weights to the feature vectors of the neighboring nodes (and the node itself) with $ tilde{A}^T X W^T$. We can rewrite the previous operation as follows: . $$h_i = sum_{j in mathcal{N}_i} mathbf{W} x_j$$ . becomes $$H = tilde{A}^T X W^T$$ . H = A_tilde.T @ X @ W.T print(f&#39;H = A_tilde.T @ X @ W.T {H.shape}&#39;) print(H) . H = A_tilde.T @ X @ W.T (34, 34) [[1 1 1 ... 1 0 0] [1 1 1 ... 0 0 0] [1 1 1 ... 0 1 0] ... [1 0 0 ... 1 1 1] [0 0 1 ... 1 1 1] [0 0 0 ... 1 1 1]] . Now we would like to normalize $H$ by the number of neighbors as seen previously. We can use the degree matrix $D$ that counts the number of neighbors for each node. In our case, we want the matrix $ tilde{D}$, based on $ tilde{A}$ instead of $A$. . D = np.zeros(A.shape, dtype=int) np.fill_diagonal(D, A.sum(axis=0)) print(f&#39;D = {D.shape}&#39;) print(D) D_tilde = np.zeros(D.shape, dtype=int) np.fill_diagonal(D_tilde, A_tilde.sum(axis=0)) print(f&#39; nD_tilde = {D_tilde.shape}&#39;) print(D_tilde) . D = (34, 34) [[16 0 0 ... 0 0 0] [ 0 9 0 ... 0 0 0] [ 0 0 10 ... 0 0 0] ... [ 0 0 0 ... 6 0 0] [ 0 0 0 ... 0 12 0] [ 0 0 0 ... 0 0 17]] D_tilde = (34, 34) [[17 0 0 ... 0 0 0] [ 0 10 0 ... 0 0 0] [ 0 0 11 ... 0 0 0] ... [ 0 0 0 ... 7 0 0] [ 0 0 0 ... 0 13 0] [ 0 0 0 ... 0 0 18]] . We could use D to calculate either: . $ tilde{D}^{-1} tilde{A}$ to normalize every row in $ tilde{A}$; | $ tilde{A} tilde{D}^{-1}$ to normalize every column in $ tilde{A}$. | . In our case, $ tilde{A}$ is symmetric so the results would be the equivalent. We can thus translate the normalized operation as follows: . $$h_i = dfrac{1}{deg(i)} sum_{j in mathcal{N}_i} mathbf{W} x_j$$ . becomes $$H = tilde{D}^{-1} tilde{A}^T X W^T$$ . D_inv = np.linalg.inv(D_tilde) print(f&#39;D_inv = {D_inv.shape}&#39;) print(D_inv) H = D_inv @ A_tilde.T @ X @ W.T print(f&#39; nH = D_inv @ A.T @ X @ W.T {H.shape}&#39;) print(H) . D_inv = (34, 34) [[0.05882353 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0. ] [0. 0.1 0. ... 0. 0. 0. ] [0. 0. 0.09090909 ... 0. 0. 0. ] ...

The previous operation is exactly what a Graph Neural Network could do. In reality, there are many ways to define a message passing layer. The good news is that it&#39;s handled by PyTorch Geometric, so we don&#39;t need to reimplement GNN layers with matrix multiplication from scratch. Now, let&#39;s see how it&#39;s done. . &#129504; III. Graph Neural Network . One of the simplest GNN layer is called GCNConv in PyG for Graph Convolutional Network, and was introduced in Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks. The main idea is that feature vectors from nodes with a lot of neighbors will spread very easily, unlike ones from more isolated nodes. The authors proposed to use a weighted average operation to counterbalance this effect, by giving bigger weights to feature vectors from nodes with few neighbors. This operation can be written as follows: . $$h_i = sum_{j in mathcal{N}_i} dfrac{1}{ sqrt{deg(i)} sqrt{deg(j)}} mathbf{W} x_j$$ . Or with matrices: . $$H = tilde{D}^{-1/2} tilde{A}^T tilde{D}^{-1/2} X W^T$$ . Notice that is $v$ and $i$ have the same number of neighbors, it is equivalent to our own message passing layer. . D_inv12 = np.linalg.inv(D_tilde) np.fill_diagonal(D_inv12, 1/ (D_tilde.diagonal()**0.5)) # New H H = D_inv12 @ A_tilde.T @ D_inv12 @ X @ W.T print(f&#39; nH = D_inv12 @ A.T @ D_inv12 @ X @ W.T {H.shape}&#39;) print(H) . H = D_inv12 @ A.T @ D_inv12 @ X @ W.T (34, 34) [[0.05882353 0.0766965 0.07312724 ... 0.09166985 0. 0. ] [0.0766965 0.1 0.09534626 ... 0. 0. 0. ] [0.07312724 0.09534626 0.09090909 ... 0. 0.0836242 0. ] ... [0.09166985 0. 0. ... 0.14285714 0.10482848 0.08908708] [0. 0. 0.0836242 ... 0.10482848 0.07692308 0.06537205] [0. 0. 0. ... 0.08908708 0.06537205 0.05555556]] . However, edges are not always bidirectional so nodes can have different numbers of neighbors. This is why the result of this operation is different from the one we designed. It is a clever trick to take into account another difference between graphs and images. . Actually, this layer is the only difference between GNNs and regular neural networks. Indeed, the result of the GCNConv layer is fed to a classic non-linear activation function, such as $tanh$ or $ReLU$ (otherwise it&#39;s just a fancy linear regression). Finally, since it&#39;s a classification task, we add a linear layer $Z$ with 4 neurons (our 4 groups) that outputs logits. In these logits, the maximum value of each row determines the class of a node. . $$X to H(X) to ReLU(H(X)) to Z(ReLU(H(X)))$$ . The definition of a GNN looks like a regular PyTorch code, with the addition of the GCNConv layer (courtesy of PyG). Here is a simple example with only one layer: . import torch from torch.nn import Linear from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv class GNN(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.gcn = GCNConv(dataset.num_features, 3) self.out = Linear(3, dataset.num_classes) def forward(self, x, edge_index): h = self.gcn(x, edge_index) embedding = torch.relu(h) z = self.out(embedding) return h, embedding, z model = GNN() print(model) . GNN( (gcn): GCNConv(34, 3) (out): Linear(in_features=3, out_features=4, bias=True) ) . As you can imagine, adding a second GCN layer would allow the network to not only aggregate feature vectors from the neighbors of each node, but also from the neighbors of these neighbors. We can stack several message passing layers to aggregate more and more distant values, but there&#39;s a catch: if we add too many layers, the aggregation becomes so intense that all the nodes end up looking the same despite being vastly different. This phenomenon is called over-smoothing and can be a real problem. Fortunately, we don&#39;t have to worry about it in this example because we only have one layer. . Now that we&#39;ve defined our GNN, let&#39;s write a simple training loop with PyTorch. I chose a regular cross-entropy loss since it&#39;s a multi-class classification task, with Adam as optimizer. We could use the data.train_mask, but since there is no test data, we can solemnly ignore it for the purpose of this exploratory exercise. The training loop is very standard: we try to predict the correct labels, and we compare the results given by $Z(ReLU(H))$ to the labels data.y from the dataset. The error calculated by the cross-entropy loss is backpropagated with Adam to fine-tune our GNN&#39;s weights and biases. Finally, we print metrics to see the progression every 10 epochs. . model = GNN() criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss() optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.02) # Calculate accuracy def accuracy(pred_y, y): return (pred_y == y).sum() / len(y) # Data for animations embeddings = [] losses = [] accuracies = [] outputs = [] # Training loop for epoch in range(201): # Clear gradients optimizer.zero_grad() # Forward pass h, embedding, z = model(data.x, data.edge_index) # Calculate loss function loss = criterion(z, data.y) # Calculate accuracy acc = accuracy(z.argmax(dim=1), data.y) # Compute gradients loss.backward() # Tune parameters optimizer.step() # Store data for animations embeddings.append(embedding) losses.append(loss) accuracies.append(acc) outputs.append(z.argmax(dim=1)) # Print metrics every 10 epochs if epoch % 10 == 0: print(f&#39;Epoch {epoch:&gt;3} | Loss: {loss:.2f} | Acc: {acc*100:.2f}%&#39;) . Epoch 0 | Loss: 1.35 | Acc: 38.24% Epoch 10 | Loss: 1.21 | Acc: 38.24% Epoch 20 | Loss: 1.08 | Acc: 41.18% Epoch 30 | Loss: 0.92 | Acc: 70.59% Epoch 40 | Loss: 0.72 | Acc: 73.53% Epoch 50 | Loss: 0.54 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 60 | Loss: 0.41 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 70 | Loss: 0.33 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 80 | Loss: 0.29 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 90 | Loss: 0.26 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 100 | Loss: 0.24 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 110 | Loss: 0.23 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 120 | Loss: 0.22 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 130 | Loss: 0.22 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 140 | Loss: 0.21 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 150 | Loss: 0.20 | Acc: 88.24% Epoch 160 | Loss: 0.20 | Acc: 91.18% Epoch 170 | Loss: 0.19 | Acc: 97.06% Epoch 180 | Loss: 0.17 | Acc: 100.00% Epoch 190 | Loss: 0.14 | Acc: 100.00% Epoch 200 | Loss: 0.12 | Acc: 100.00% . Great! Without much surprise, we reach 100% accuracy on the training set. It means that our model learned to correctly assign every member of the karate club to its correct group. We can do something quite cool by animating the graph to see the evolution of the GNN&#39;s predictions during the training process. . %%capture from IPython.display import HTML from matplotlib import animation plt.rcParams[&quot;animation.bitrate&quot;] = 3000 def animate(i): G = to_networkx(data, to_undirected=True) nx.draw_networkx(G, pos=nx.spring_layout(G, seed=0), with_labels=True, node_size=800, node_color=outputs[i], cmap=&quot;hsv&quot;, vmin=-2, vmax=3, width=0.8, edge_color=&quot;grey&quot;, font_size=14 ) plt.title(f&#39;Epoch {i} | Loss: {losses[i]:.2f} | Acc: {accuracies[i]*100:.2f}%&#39;, fontsize=18, pad=20) fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12)) plt.axis(&#39;off&#39;) anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, np.arange(0, 200, 10), interval=500, repeat=True) html = HTML(anim.to_html5_video()) . display(html) . Your browser does not support the video tag. The GNN struggles a bit at the beginning, but it perfectly labels every node after a while. Indeed, the final graph is the same than the one we plotted at the end of the first part of this article. Okay this is nice, but what does the GNN really learn? . We talked about message passing as a generalized convolution operation, where feature vectors from each neighboring node contribute to a better understanding of the &quot;central&quot; node. This is exactly what GNNs learn: a representation of the information of every node, also called an embedding. In our model, the linear classifier $Z$ on top of it just learns how to use these embeddings to produce the best classifications, but the embeddings are the real product of GNNs. . Let&#39;s print the 3D embeddings for each of the 34 nodes with the result of the ReLU layer $ReLU(H(x))$, aptly named embedding. . print(f&#39;Final embeddings = {embedding.shape}&#39;) print(embedding) . Final embeddings = torch.Size([34, 3]) tensor([[2.3756e+00, 5.1330e-01, 0.0000e+00], [3.2511e+00, 1.4347e+00, 0.0000e+00], [2.0562e+00, 1.5209e+00, 0.0000e+00], [2.9461e+00, 1.1436e+00, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 0.0000e+00, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 0.0000e+00, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 0.0000e+00, 0.0000e+00], [2.4295e+00, 1.0172e+00, 0.0000e+00], [6.3575e-01, 2.6594e+00, 0.0000e+00], [1.9876e+00, 1.3767e+00, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 6.0713e-04, 0.0000e+00], [2.2577e+00, 1.1747e+00, 0.0000e+00], [2.3823e+00, 1.1449e+00, 0.0000e+00], [2.2940e+00, 1.3844e+00, 0.0000e+00], [1.9155e-01, 2.7673e+00, 0.0000e+00], [1.8206e-01, 2.7194e+00, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 2.0684e-03, 0.0000e+00], [2.3367e+00, 1.1042e+00, 0.0000e+00], [1.7925e-01, 2.7942e+00, 0.0000e+00], [2.0630e+00, 1.4096e+00, 0.0000e+00], [1.9360e-01, 2.7587e+00, 0.0000e+00], [2.2845e+00, 1.1088e+00, 0.0000e+00], [1.8486e-01, 2.7376e+00, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 2.8447e+00, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 8.9724e-01, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 9.5606e-01, 0.0000e+00], [2.1157e-01, 2.8055e+00, 0.0000e+00], [2.6385e-01, 2.4765e+00, 0.0000e+00], [2.9965e-01, 8.5145e-01, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 3.3316e+00, 0.0000e+00], [4.0497e-01, 2.8716e+00, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 6.8132e-01, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 4.1963e+00, 0.0000e+00], [0.0000e+00, 3.8991e+00, 0.0000e+00]], grad_fn=&lt;ReluBackward0&gt;) . As you can see, embeddings do not need to have the same dimensions as feature vectors. Here, I chose to reduce the number of dimensions from 34 (dataset.num_features) to 3 to get a nice visualization in 3D. Let&#39;s plot these embeddings before any training happens, at epoch 0. . embed = embeddings[0].detach().cpu().numpy() fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12)) ax = fig.add_subplot(projection=&#39;3d&#39;) ax.patch.set_alpha(0) plt.tick_params(left=False, bottom=False, labelleft=False, labelbottom=False) ax.scatter(embed[:, 0], embed[:, 1], embed[:, 2], s=200, c=data.y, cmap=&quot;hsv&quot;, vmin=-2, vmax=3) plt.show() . Okay, we see every node from our graph, with the color corresponding to its real group (and not the model&#39;s prediction). For now, they&#39;re all over the place since the GNN is not trained yet. But if we plot these embeddings at each step of the training loop, we&#39;d be able to visualize what the GNN truly learns. We would see how the embeddings change over time, as the GNN gets better and better at classifying nodes. . This is exactly what the following animation does. . %%capture def animate(i): embed = embeddings[i].detach().cpu().numpy() ax.clear() ax.scatter(embed[:, 0], embed[:, 1], embed[:, 2], s=200, c=data.y, cmap=&quot;hsv&quot;, vmin=-2, vmax=3) plt.title(f&#39;Epoch {i} | Loss: {losses[i]:.2f} | Acc: {accuracies[i]*100:.2f}%&#39;, fontsize=18, pad=40) fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12)) plt.axis(&#39;off&#39;) ax = fig.add_subplot(projection=&#39;3d&#39;) plt.tick_params(left=False, bottom=False, labelleft=False, labelbottom=False) anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, np.arange(0, 200, 10), interval=800, repeat=True) html = HTML(anim.to_html5_video()) . display(html) . Your browser does not support the video tag. Let&#39;s unpack it. During training, we know that GNNs learn to produce the best embeddings possible for a specific task. In practice, we see that it means nodes from the same class are grouped into nice clusters. It makes the job of the linear classification layer quite simple because you can easily draw planes to separate each cluster. . Embeddings are not unique to GNNs: they can be found everywhere in deep learning. They don&#39;t have to be 3D either: actually, they rarely are. For instance, language models like BERT produce embeddings with 768 or even 1024 dimensions (and other models go much higher!). Additional dimensions allow to store more information about nodes, text, images, etc. but they also create bigger models that are more difficult and take longer to train. This is why it&#39;s better to keep low-dimensional embeddings as long as it&#39;s possible. . &#128282; IV. Conclusion . Graph Neural Networks are a powerful architecture that is less difficult to understand than at first glance. In this article, . We learned to use the PyTorch Geometric library to explore graph data with the Datasets and Data objects; | We redesigned a message passing layer from scratch, based on a tweaked convolutional layer to work with graphs and not just images; | We implemented a real GNN with a GCN layer that is very close to our own design; | We visualized what and how our GNN learns with the clustering of the node embeddings. | . Zachary&#39;s karate club is not the best graph dataset (feature vectors are useless), but it is good enough to understand the most important concepts in graph data and GNNs. We only talked about node classification in this work, but there are other tasks GNNs can accomplish: link prediction (e.g., to recommend a friend), graph classification (e.g., to label molecules), etc. Beyond GCN, other GNN layers and architectures were proposed by researchers. In the next article, we&#39;re gonna talk about Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which implicitly compute GCN&#39;s normalization factor and the importance of each connection with an attention mechanism. .

            "title": "Q-learning for beginners",
            "content": "The goal of this article is to teach an AI how to solve the ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake environment using reinforcement learning. Instead of reading Wikipedia articles and explaining formulas, we&#39;re going to start from scratch and try to recreate the ü§ñQ-learning algorithm by ourselves. We&#39;ll not just understand how it works, but more importantly why it works: why was it designed that way? What are the hidden assumptions, the details that are never explained in regular courses and tutorials? . At the end of this article, you&#39;ll master the Q-learning algorithm and be able to apply it to other environments and real-world problems. It&#39;s a cool mini-project that gives a better insight into how reinforcement learning works and can hopefully inspire ideas for original and creative applications. . Let&#39;s start by installing the ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake environment and importing the necessary libraries: gym for the game, random to generate random numbers, and numpy to do some math. . !pip install -q gym !pip install -q matplotlib import gym import random import numpy as np . &#10052;&#65039; I. Frozen Lake . Now, let&#39;s talk about the game we&#39;re going to be solving in this tutorial. ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake is a simple environment composed of tiles, where the AI has to move from an initial tile to a goal. Tiles can be a safe frozen lake ‚úÖ, or a hole ‚ùå that gets you stuck forever. The AI, or agent, has 4 possible actions: go ‚óÄÔ∏èLEFT, üîΩDOWN, ‚ñ∂Ô∏èRIGHT, or üîºUP. The agent must learn to avoid holes in order to reach the goal in a minimal number of actions. By default, the environment is always in the same configuration. In the environment&#39;s code, each tile is represented by a letter as follows: . S F F F (S: starting point, safe) F H F H (F: frozen surface, safe) F F F H (H: hole, stuck forever) H F F G (G: goal, safe) . &lt;/source&gt; We can try to manually solve the example above to understand the game. Let&#39;s see if the following sequence of actions is a correct solution: RIGHT $ to$ RIGHT $ to$ RIGHT $ to$ DOWN $ to$ DOWN $ to$ DOWN. Our agent starts on tile S, so we move right on a frozen surface ‚úÖ, then again ‚úÖ, then once more ‚úÖ, then we go down and find a hole ‚ùå. . Actually, it&#39;s really easy to find several correct solutions: RIGHT $ to$ RIGHT $ to$ DOWN $ to$ DOWN $ to$ DOWN $ to$ RIGHT is an obvious one. But we could make a sequence of actions that loops around a hole 10 times before reaching the goal. This sequence is valid, but it doesn&#39;t meet our final requirement: the agent needs to meet the goal in a minimum number of actions. In this example, the minimum number of actions to complete the game is 6. We need to remember this fact to check if our agent really masters ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake or not. . &lt;/source&gt; Let&#39;s initialize the environment thanks to the gym library. There are two versions of the game: one with slippery ice, where selected actions have a random chance of being disregarded by the agent; and a non-slippery one, where actions cannot be ignored. We&#39;ll use the non-slippery one to begin with because it&#39;s easier to understand. . environment = gym.make(&quot;FrozenLake-v1&quot;, is_slippery=False) environment.reset() environment.render() . SFFF FHFH FFFH HFFG . We can see that the game that was created has the exact same configuration as in our example: it is the same puzzle. The position of our agent is indicated by a red rectangle. Solving this puzzle can be done with a simple script and if...else conditions, which would actually be useful to compare our AI to a simpler approach. However, we want to try a more exciting solution: reinforcement learning. . &#127937; II. Q-table . In ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake, there are 16 tiles, which means our agent can be found in 16 different positions, called states. For each state, there are 4 possible actions: go ‚óÄÔ∏èLEFT, üîΩDOWN, ‚ñ∂Ô∏èRIGHT, and üîºUP. Learning how to play Frozen Lake is like learning which action you should choose in every state. To know which action is the best in a given state, we would like to assign a quality value to our actions. We have 16 states and 4 actions, so want to calculate $16 times 4 = 64$ values. . A nice way of representing it is using a table, known as a Q-table, where rows list every state $s$ and columns list every action $a$. In this Q-table, each cell contains a value $Q(s, a)$, which is the value (quality) of the action $a$ in the state $s$ (1 if it&#39;s the best action possible, 0 if it&#39;s really bad). When our agent is in a particular state $s$, it just has to check this table to see which action has the highest value. Taking the action with the highest value makes sense but we&#39;ll see later that we can design something even better... . State ‚óÄÔ∏èLEFT üîΩDOWN ‚ñ∂Ô∏èRIGHT üîºUP . S=0 | Q(0, ‚óÄÔ∏è) | Q(0, üîΩ) | Q(0, ‚ñ∂Ô∏è) | Q(0, üîº) | . 1 | Q(1, ‚óÄÔ∏è) | Q(1, üîΩ) | Q(1, ‚ñ∂Ô∏è) | Q(1, üîº) | . 2 | Q(2, ‚óÄÔ∏è) | Q(2, üîΩ) | Q(2, ‚ñ∂Ô∏è) | Q(2, üîº) | . ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 14 | Q(14, ‚óÄÔ∏è) | Q(14, üîΩ) | Q(14, ‚ñ∂Ô∏è) | Q(14, üîº) | . G=15 | Q(15, ‚óÄÔ∏è) | Q(15, üîΩ) | Q(15, ‚ñ∂Ô∏è) | Q(15, üîº) | . Example of Q-table, where each cell contains the value $Q(a, s)$ of the action $a$ (column) in a given state $s$ (row)Let&#39;s create our Q-table and fill it with zeros since we still have no idea of the value of each action in each state. . # Our table has the following dimensions: # (rows x columns) = (states x actions) = (16 x 4) qtable = np.zeros((16, 4)) # Alternatively, the gym library can also directly g # give us the number of states and actions using # &quot;env.observation_space.n&quot; and &quot;env.action_space.n&quot; nb_states = environment.observation_space.n # = 16 nb_actions = environment.action_space.n # = 4 qtable = np.zeros((nb_states, nb_actions)) # Let&#39;s see how it looks print(&#39;Q-table =&#39;) print(qtable) . Q-table = [[0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0. 0.]] . Great! We have our Q-table with 16 rows (our 16 states) and 4 columns (our 4 actions) as expected. Let&#39;s try to see what we can do next: every value is set to zero, so we have no information at all. Let&#39;s say that the agent takes a random action: ‚óÄÔ∏èLEFT, üîΩDOWN, ‚ñ∂Ô∏èRIGHT, or üîºUP. . We can use the random library with the choice method to randomly choose an action. . random.choice([&quot;LEFT&quot;, &quot;DOWN&quot;, &quot;RIGHT&quot;, &quot;UP&quot;]) . &#39;LEFT&#39; . Wait, actually the agent is currently on the initial state S, which means only two actions are possible: ‚ñ∂Ô∏èRIGHT and üîΩDOWN. The agent can also take the actions üîºUP and ‚óÄÔ∏èLEFT, but it won&#39;t move: its state doesn&#39;t change. Therefore, we do not put any constraint on what actions are possible: the agent will naturally understand that some of them don&#39;t do anything. . We can keep using random.choice(), but the gym library already implements a method to randomly choose an action. It might save us some hassle later, so let&#39;s try it. . environment.action_space.sample() . 0 . Oops... this time it&#39;s a number. We could read gym&#39;s documentation but it is quite scarce unfortunately. No worries though, we can check the source code on GitHub to understand what these numbers mean. It&#39;s actually super straightforward: . ‚óÄÔ∏è LEFT = 0 üîΩ DOWN = 1 ‚ñ∂Ô∏è RIGHT = 2 üîº UP = 3 . &lt;/source&gt; Okay, now that we understand how gym connects numbers to directions, let&#39;s try to use it to move our agent to the right ‚ñ∂Ô∏è. This time, it can be performed using the step(action) method. We can try to directly provide it the number 2, corresponding to the direction we chose (right), and check if the agent moved. . environment.step(2) environment.render() . (Right) SFFF FHFH FFFH HFFG . Huzzah! The red square moved from the initial state S to the right: our prediction was correct. And that&#39;s all we need to know in order to interact with the environment: . How to randomly choose an action using action_space.sample(); | How to implement this action and move our agent in the desired direction with step(action). | To be completely exhaustive, we can add: . How to display the current map to see what we&#39;re doing with render(); | How to restart the game when the agent falls into a hole or reaches the goal G with reset(). | Now that we understand how to interact with our gym environment, let&#39;s go back to our algorithm. In reinforcement learning, agents are rewarded by the environment when they accomplish a predefined goal. In ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake, the agent is only rewarded when it reaches the state G (see the source code). We cannot control this reward, it is set in the environment: it&#39;s 1 when the agent reaches G, and 0 otherwise. . Let&#39;s print it every time we implement an action. The reward is given by the method step(action). . action = environment.action_space.sample() # 2. Implement this action and move the agent in the desired direction new_state, reward, done, info = environment.step(action) # Display the results (reward and map) environment.render() print(f&#39;Reward = {reward}&#39;) . (Left) SFFF FHFH FFFH HFFG Reward = 0.0 . The reward is indeed 0... üò± wow, I guess we&#39;re in a pickle, because only one state can give us a positive reward in the entire game. How are we supposed to take the right directions at the very beginning when the only validation we have is at the very end? If we ever want to see a reward of 1, we&#39;d need to be lucky enough to find the correct sequence of actions by chance. Unfortunately, that&#39;s exactly how it works... the Q-table will remain filled with zeros until the agent randomly reaches the goal G. . The problem would be much simpler if we could have intermediate, smaller rewards to guide our path towards the goal G. Alas, this is actually one of the main issues of reinforcement learning: this phenomenon, called sparse rewards, makes agents very difficult to train on problems where the only reward is at the end of a long sequence of actions. Different techniques were proposed to mitigate this issue, but we&#39;ll talk about it another time. . &#129302; III. Q-learning . Let&#39;s go back to our problem. Okay, we need to be lucky enough to find the goal G by accident. But once it&#39;s done, how to backpropagate the information to the initial state? The ü§ñQ-learning algorithm offers a clever solution to this issue. We need to update the value of our state-action pairs (each cell in the Q-table) considering 1/ the reward for reaching the next state, and 2/ the highest possible value in the next state. . &lt;/source&gt; We know we get a reward of 1 when we move to G. As we just said, the value of the state next to G (let&#39;s call it G-1) with the relevant action to reach G is increased thanks to the reward. Okay good, end of the episode: the agent won and we restart the game. Now, the next time the agent is in a state next to G-1, it will increase the value of this state (let&#39;s call it G-2) with the relevant action to reach G-1. The next time the agent is in a state next to G-2, it will do the same. Rinse and repeat, until the update reaches the initial state S. . Let&#39;s try to find the update formula to backpropagate the values from G to S. Remember: values denote the quality of an action in a specific state (0 if it&#39;s terrible, 1 if it&#39;s the best action possible in this state). We try to update the value of the action $a_t$ (for example, $a_t = 0$ if the action is left) in the state $s_t$ (for example, $s_t = 0$ when the agent is in the initial state S). This value is just a cell in our Q-table, corresponding to the row number $s_t$ and the column number $a_t$: this value is formally called $Q(s_t, a_t)$. . As we said previously, we need to update it using 1/ the reward for the next state (formally noted $r_t$), and 2/ the maximum possible value in the next state ($max_aQ(s_{t+1},a)$). Therefore, the update formula must look like: . $$Q_{new}(s_t, a_t) = Q(s_t, a_t) + r_t + max_aQ(s_{t+1}, a)$$ . The new value is the current one + the reward + the highest value in the next state. We can manually try our formula to check if it looks correct: let&#39;s pretend our agent is in the state G-1 next to the goal G for the first time. We can update the value corresponding to the winning action in this state G-1 with $Q_{new}(G-1, a_t) = Q(G-1, a_t) + r_t + max_aQ(G, a)$, where $Q(G-1, a_t) = 0$ and $max_aQ(G, a) = 0$ because the Q-table is empty, and $r_t = 1$ because we get the only reward in this environment. We obtain $Q_{new}(G-1, a_t) = 1$. The next time the agent is in a state next to this one (G-2), we update it too using the formula and get the same result: $Q_{new}(G-2, a_t) = 1$. In the end, we backpropagate ones in the Q-table from G to S. Okay it works, but the result is binary: either it&#39;s the wrong state-action pair or the best one. We would like more nuance... . Actually, we almost found the true Q-learning update formula with common sense. The nuance we&#39;re looking for adds two parameters: . $ alpha$ is the üí°learning rate (between $0$ and $1$), which is how much we should change the original $Q(s_t, a_t)$ value. If $ alpha = 0$, the value never changes, but if $ alpha = 1$, the value changes extremely fast. In our attempt, we didn&#39;t limit the learning rate so $ alpha = 1$. But this is too fast in reality: the reward and the maximum value in the next state quickly overpower the current value. We need to find a balance between the importance of past and new knowledge. | $ gamma$ is the üìâdiscount factor (between $0$ and $1$), which determines how much the agent cares about future rewards compared to immediate ones (as the saying goes, &quot;a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush&quot;). If $ gamma = 0$, the agent only focuses on immediate rewards , but if $ gamma = 1$, any potential future reward has the same value than current ones. In ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake, we want a high discount factor since there&#39;s only one possible reward at the very end of the game. | . With the real Q-learning algorithm, the new value is calculated as follows: . $$Q_{new}(s_t, a_t) = Q(s_t, a_t) + alpha cdot (r_t + gamma cdot max_aQ(s_{t+1},a) - Q(s_t, a_t))$$ . Okay, let&#39;s try this new formula before implementing it. Once again, we can pretend that our agent is next to the goal G for the first time. We can update the state-action pair to win the game using our formula: $Q_{new}(G-1, a_t) = 0 + alpha cdot (1 + gamma cdot 0 - 0)$. We can assign arbitrary values to $ alpha$ and $ gamma$ to calculate the result. With $ alpha = 0.5$ and $ gamma = 0.9$, we get $Q_{new}(G-1, a_t) = 0 + 0.5 cdot (1 + 0.9 cdot 0 - 0) = 0.5$. The second time the agent is in this state, we would get: $Q_{new}(G-1, a_t) = 0.5 + 0.5 cdot (1 + 0.9 cdot 0 - 0.5) = 0.75$, then $0.875$, $0.9375$, $0.96875$, etc. . &lt;/source&gt; So training our agent in code means: . Choosing a random action (using action_space.sample()) if the values in the current state are just zeros. Otherwise, we take the action with the highest value in the current state with the function np.argmax(); | Implementing this action by moving in the desired direction with step(action); | Updating the value of the original state with the action we took, using information about the new state and the reward given by step(action); | We keep repeating these 3 steps until the agent gets stuck in a hole or reaches the goal G. When it happens, we just restart the environment with reset() and start a new episode until we hit 1,000 episodes. Additionally, we can plot the outcome of each run (failure if it didn&#39;t reach the goal, success otherwise) to observe the progress of our agent. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.rcParams[&#39;figure.dpi&#39;] = 300 plt.rcParams.update({&#39;font.size&#39;: 17}) # We re-initialize the Q-table qtable = np.zeros((environment.observation_space.n, environment.action_space.n)) # Hyperparameters episodes = 1000 # Total number of episodes alpha = 0.5 # Learning rate gamma = 0.9 # Discount factor # List of outcomes to plot outcomes = [] print(&#39;Q-table before training:&#39;) print(qtable) # Training for _ in range(episodes): state = environment.reset() done = False # By default, we consider our outcome to be a failure outcomes.append(&quot;Failure&quot;) # Until the agent gets stuck in a hole or reaches the goal, keep training it while not done: # Choose the action with the highest value in the current state if np.max(qtable[state]) &gt; 0: action = np.argmax(qtable[state]) # If there&#39;s no best action (only zeros), take a random one else: action = environment.action_space.sample() # Implement this action and move the agent in the desired direction new_state, reward, done, info = environment.step(action) # Update Q(s,a) qtable[state, action] = qtable[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(qtable[new_state]) - qtable[state, action]) # Update our current state state = new_state # If we have a reward, it means that our outcome is a success if reward: outcomes[-1] = &quot;Success&quot; print() print(&#39;===========================================&#39;) print(&#39;Q-table after training:&#39;) print(qtable) # Plot outcomes plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5)) plt.xlabel(&quot;Run number&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Outcome&quot;) ax = plt.gca() ax.set_facecolor(&#39;#efeeea&#39;) plt.bar(range(len(outcomes)), outcomes, color=&quot;#0A047A&quot;, width=1.0) plt.show() .

The agent is trained! Each blue bar on the figure corresponds to a win, so we can see that the agent had a hard time finding the goal at the beginning of the training. But once it found it several times in a row, it began to consistently win. ü•≥ The trained Q-table is also very interesting: these values indicate the unique sequence of actions the agent learned to reach the goal. . Now let&#39;s see how it performs by evaluating it on 100 episodes. We consider that the training is over, so we don&#39;t need to update the Q-table anymore. To see how the agent performs, we can calculate the percentage of times the it managed to reach the goal (success rate). . episodes = 100 nb_success = 0 # Evaluation for _ in range(100): state = environment.reset() done = False # Until the agent gets stuck or reaches the goal, keep training it while not done: # Choose the action with the highest value in the current state if np.max(qtable[state]) &gt; 0: action = np.argmax(qtable[state]) # If there&#39;s no best action (only zeros), take a random one else: action = environment.action_space.sample() # Implement this action and move the agent in the desired direction new_state, reward, done, info = environment.step(action) # Update our current state state = new_state # When we get a reward, it means we solved the game nb_success += reward # Let&#39;s check our success rate! print (f&quot;Success rate = {nb_success/episodes*100}%&quot;) . Success rate = 100.0% . Not only our agent has been trained, but it manages to hit a 100% success rate. Great job everyone, the non-slippery ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake is solved! . We can even visualize the agent moving on the map by executing the code below and print the sequence of actions it took to check if it&#39;s the best one. . from IPython.display import clear_output import time state = environment.reset() done = False sequence = [] while not done: # Choose the action with the highest value in the current state if np.max(qtable[state]) &gt; 0: action = np.argmax(qtable[state]) # If there&#39;s no best action (only zeros), take a random one else: action = environment.action_space.sample() # Add the action to the sequence sequence.append(action) # Implement this action and move the agent in the desired direction new_state, reward, done, info = environment.step(action) # Update our current state state = new_state # Update the render clear_output(wait=True) environment.render() time.sleep(1) print(f&quot;Sequence = {sequence}&quot;) . (Right) SFFF FHFH FFFH HFFG Sequence = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2] . The agent can learn several correct sequence of actions: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2], etc. The good thing is there&#39;s only 6 actions in our sequence, which was the minimum possible number of actions we counted: it means that our agent learned to solve the game in an optimal way. In the case of [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2], which corresponds to RIGHT $ to$ RIGHT $ to$ DOWN $ to$ DOWN $ to$ DOWN $ to$ RIGHT, it&#39;s exactly the sequence we predicted at the very beginning of the article. üì£ . &#128208; IV. Epsilon-Greedy algorithm . Despite this success, there&#39;s something that bothers me with our previous approach: the agent always chooses the action with the highest value. So whenever a state-action pair starts having a non-zero value, the agent will always choose it. The other actions will never be taken, which means we&#39;ll never update their value... But what if one of these actions was better than the one the agent always takes? Shouldn&#39;t we encourage the agent to try news things from time to time and see if it can improve? . In other words, we want to allow our agent to either: . Take the action with the highest value (exploitation); | Choose a random action to try to find even better ones (exploration). | . A tradeoff between these two behaviors is important: if the agent only focuses on exploitation, it cannot try new solutions and thus doesn&#39;t learn anymore. On the other hand, if the agent only takes random actions, the training is pointless since it doesn&#39;t use the Q-table. So we want to change this parameter over time: at the beginning of the training, we want to explore the environment as much as possible. But exploration becomes less and less interesting, as the agent already knows every possible state-action pairs. This parameter represents the amount of randomness in the action selection. . This technique is commonly called the epsilon-greedy algorithm, where epsilon is our parameter. It is a simple but extremely efficient method to find a good tradeoff. Every time the agent has to take an action, it has a probability $Œµ$ of choosing a random one, and a probability $1-Œµ$ of choosing the one with the highest value. We can decrease the value of epsilon at the end of each episode by a fixed amount (linear decay), or based on the current value of epsilon (exponential decay). . &lt;/source&gt; Let&#39;s implement a linear decay. Beforehand, I&#39;d like to see how the curve looks like with arbitrary parameters. We&#39;ll start with $Œµ = 1$ to be in full exploration mode, and decrease this value by $0.001$ after each episode. . Okay now that we have a sound understanding of it, we can implement it for real and see how it changes the agent&#39;s behavior. . qtable = np.zeros((environment.observation_space.n, environment.action_space.n)) # Hyperparameters episodes = 1000 # Total number of episodes alpha = 0.5 # Learning rate gamma = 0.9 # Discount factor epsilon = 1.0 # Amount of randomness in the action selection epsilon_decay = 0.001 # Fixed amount to decrease # List of outcomes to plot outcomes = [] print(&#39;Q-table before training:&#39;) print(qtable) # Training for _ in range(episodes): state = environment.reset() done = False # By default, we consider our outcome to be a failure outcomes.append(&quot;Failure&quot;) # Until the agent gets stuck in a hole or reaches the goal, keep training it while not done: # Generate a random number between 0 and 1 rnd = np.random.random() # If random number &lt; epsilon, take a random action if rnd &lt; epsilon: action = environment.action_space.sample() # Else, take the action with the highest value in the current state else: action = np.argmax(qtable[state]) # Implement this action and move the agent in the desired direction new_state, reward, done, info = environment.step(action) # Update Q(s,a) qtable[state, action] = qtable[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(qtable[new_state]) - qtable[state, action]) # Update our current state state = new_state # If we have a reward, it means that our outcome is a success if reward: outcomes[-1] = &quot;Success&quot; # Update epsilon epsilon = max(epsilon - epsilon_decay, 0) print() print(&#39;===========================================&#39;) print(&#39;Q-table after training:&#39;) print(qtable) # Plot outcomes plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5)) plt.xlabel(&quot;Run number&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Outcome&quot;) ax = plt.gca() ax.set_facecolor(&#39;#efeeea&#39;) plt.bar(range(len(outcomes)), outcomes, color=&quot;#0A047A&quot;, width=1.0) plt.show() .

Hey, the agent takes more time to consistently win the game now! And the Q-table has a lot more non-zero values than the previous one, which means the agent has learned several sequences of actions to reach the goal. It is understandable, since this new agent is forced to explore state-action pairs instead of always exploiting ones with non-zero values. . Let&#39;s see if it&#39;s as successful as the previous one to win the game. In evaluation mode, we don&#39;t want exploration anymore because the agent is trained now. . episodes = 100 nb_success = 0 # Evaluation for _ in range(100): state = environment.reset() done = False # Until the agent gets stuck or reaches the goal, keep training it while not done: # Choose the action with the highest value in the current state action = np.argmax(qtable[state]) # Implement this action and move the agent in the desired direction new_state, reward, done, info = environment.step(action) # Update our current state state = new_state # When we get a reward, it means we solved the game nb_success += reward # Let&#39;s check our success rate! print (f&quot;Success rate = {nb_success/episodes*100}%&quot;) . Success rate = 100.0% . Phew, it&#39;s another 100% success rate! We didn&#39;t degrade the model. üòå The benefits of this approach might not be obvious in this example, but our model became less static and more flexible. It learned different paths (sequences of actions) from S to G instead of just one as in the previous approach. More exploration can degrade performance but it&#39;s necessary to train agents that can adapt to new environments. . &#10052;&#65039; IV. Challenge: slippery Frozen Lake . We didn&#39;t solve the entire ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake environment: we only trained an agent on the non-slippery version, using is_slippery = False during initialization. In the slippery variant, the action the agent takes only has 33% chance of succeeding. In case of failure, one of the three other actions is randomly taken instead. This feature adds a lot of randomness to the training, which makes things more difficult for our agent. Let&#39;s see how well our code is doing in this new environment... . environment = gym.make(&quot;FrozenLake-v1&quot;, is_slippery=True) environment.reset() # We re-initialize the Q-table qtable = np.zeros((environment.observation_space.n, environment.action_space.n)) # Hyperparameters episodes = 1000 # Total number of episodes alpha = 0.5 # Learning rate gamma = 0.9 # Discount factor epsilon = 1.0 # Amount of randomness in the action selection epsilon_decay = 0.001 # Fixed amount to decrease # List of outcomes to plot outcomes = [] print(&#39;Q-table before training:&#39;) print(qtable) # Training for _ in range(episodes): state = environment.reset() done = False # By default, we consider our outcome to be a failure outcomes.append(&quot;Failure&quot;) # Until the agent gets stuck in a hole or reaches the goal, keep training it while not done: # Generate a random number between 0 and 1 rnd = np.random.random() # If random number &lt; epsilon, take a random action if rnd &lt; epsilon: action = environment.action_space.sample() # Else, take the action with the highest value in the current state else: action = np.argmax(qtable[state]) # Implement this action and move the agent in the desired direction new_state, reward, done, info = environment.step(action) # Update Q(s,a) qtable[state, action] = qtable[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(qtable[new_state]) - qtable[state, action]) # Update our current state state = new_state # If we have a reward, it means that our outcome is a success if reward: outcomes[-1] = &quot;Success&quot; # Update epsilon epsilon = max(epsilon - epsilon_decay, 0) print() print(&#39;===========================================&#39;) print(&#39;Q-table after training:&#39;) print(qtable) # Plot outcomes plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5)) plt.xlabel(&quot;Run number&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Outcome&quot;) ax = plt.gca() ax.set_facecolor(&#39;#efeeea&#39;) plt.bar(range(len(outcomes)), outcomes, color=&quot;#0A047A&quot;, width=1.0) plt.show() episodes = 100 nb_success = 0 # Evaluation for _ in range(100): state = environment.reset() done = False # Until the agent gets stuck or reaches the goal, keep training it while not done: # Choose the action with the highest value in the current state action = np.argmax(qtable[state]) # Implement this action and move the agent in the desired direction new_state, reward, done, info = environment.step(action) # Update our current state state = new_state # When we get a reward, it means we solved the game nb_success += reward # Let&#39;s check our success rate! print (f&quot;Success rate = {nb_success/episodes*100}%&quot;) .

Success rate = 17.0% . Oof it&#39;s not so good. But can you improve the performance by tweaking the different parameters we talked about? I encourage you to take this little challenge and do it on your own to have fun with reinforcement learning and check if you understood everything we said about Q-learning. And why not implementing exponential decay for the epsilon-greedy algorithm too? During this quick exercise, you might realise that slightly modifying the hyperparameters can completely destroy the results. This is another quirk of reinforcement learning: hyperparameters are quite moody, and it is important to understand their meaning if you want to tweak them. It&#39;s always good to test and try new combinations to build your intuition and become more efficient. Good luck and have fun! . &#128282; V. Conclusion . Q-learning is a simple yet powerful algorithm at the core of reinforcement learning. In this article, . We learned to interact with the gym environment to choose actions and move our agent; | We introduced the idea of a Q-table, where rows are states, columns are actions, and cells are the value of an action in a given state; | We experimentally recreated the Q-learning update formula to tackle the sparse reward problem; | We implemented an entire training and evaluation process, that solved the ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake environment with 100% success rate; | We implemented the famous epsilon-greedy algorithm in order to create a tradeoff between the exploration of unknown state-action pairs and the exploitation of the most successful ones. | . The ‚ùÑÔ∏èFrozen Lake is a very simple environment, but others can have so many states and actions that it becomes impossible to store the Q-table in memory. This is especially the case in environments where events are not discrete, but continuous (like Super Mario Bros. or Minecraft). When the problem arises, a popular technique consists of training a deep neural network to approximate the Q-table. This method adds several layers of complexity, since the neural networks are not very stable. But I will cover it in another tutorial with different techniques to stabilize them. . Until then, share this article if it helped you and follow me on Twitter and Medium for more practical content around machine learning and deep learning. üì£ .",

I have a PhD in machine learning applied to cyber security from the Polytechnic Institute of Paris (number 49 in QS World University Rankings). I‚Äôve worked for the French Atomic Energy Commission, where I developed new machine learning architectures dedicated to anomaly detection and that are now sold and used in various industrial, national, and European projects. . In this blog, I want to write tutorials and guides about AI in a different way. I want to start with practice and implementation, and then move on to explanations. Even better, I would like to experimentally retrace the thought process of the original authors of the algorithms we use everyday to understand their design, the importance of each component, rather than using them as black boxes. Implementation is at the core of this process, since it is only by implementing by yourself that you discover all the assumptions and other details that are often ignored, but are nonetheless essential. Finally, I think this process is fun and allows you to practice tackling difficult problems to design new and suitable machine learning solutions. . I hope we can have fun together and learn a few things along the way. :) . If you want to contact me, feel free to send a mail at this address. . . Credits: .
